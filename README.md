compiled by DanielVarga.
I also added the quotes of the year 2014, using his script from

http://people.mokk.bme.hu/~daniel/rationality_quotes_2012/

I reformatted the quotes, fitted them to a width of 80 characters
and removed some remarks which only made sense in context
of the discussion. I did not proof-read all quotes.
