    At home there was a game that all the parents played with their
    children. It was called, What Did You See? Mara was about Dann’s age
    when she was first called into her father’s room one evening, where he
    sat in his big carved and coloured chair. He said to her, ‘And now we
    are going to play a game. What was the thing you liked best today?’

    At first she chattered: ‘I played with my cousin . . . I was out with
    Shera in the garden . . . I made a stone house.’ And then he had said,
    ‘Tell me about the house.’ And she said, ‘I made a house of the stones
    that come from the river bed.’ And he said, ‘Now tell me about the
    stones.’ And she said, ‘They were mostly smooth stones, but some were
    sharp and had different shapes.’ ‘Tell me what the stones looked like,
    what colour they were, what did they feel like.’

    And by the time the game ended she knew why some stones were smooth
    and some sharp and why they were different colours, some cracked, some
    so small they were almost sand. She knew how rivers rolled stones
    along and how some of them came from far away. She knew that the river
    had once been twice as wide as it was now. There seemed no end to what
    she knew, and yet her father had not told her much, but kept asking
    questions so she found the answers in herself. Like, ‘Why do you think
    some stones are smooth and round and some still sharp?’ And she
    thought and replied, ‘Some have been in the water a long time, rubbing
    against other stones, and some have only just been broken off bigger
    stones.’ Every evening, either her father or her mother called her in
    for What Did You See? She loved it. During the day, playing outside or
    with her toys, alone or with other children, she found herself
    thinking, Now notice what you are doing, so you can tell them tonight
    what you saw.

    She had thought that the game did not change; but then one evening she
    was there when her little brother was first asked, What Did You See?
    and she knew just how much the game had changed for her. Because now
    it was not just What Did You See? but: What were you thinking? What
    made you think that? Are you sure that thought is true?

    When she became seven, not long ago, and it was time for school, she
    was in a room with about twenty children - all from her family or from
    the Big Family - and the teacher, her mother’s sister, said, ‘And now
    the game: What Did You See?’

    Most of the children had played the game since they were tiny; but
    some had not, and they were pitied by the ones that had, for they did
    not notice much and were often silent when the others said, ‘I saw . .
    .’, whatever it was. Mara was at first upset that this game played
    with so many at once was simpler, more babyish, than when she was with
    her parents. It was like going right back to the earliest stages of
    the game: ‘What did you see?’ ‘I saw a bird.’ ‘What kind of a bird?’
    ‘It was black and white and had a yellow beak.’ ‘What shape of beak?
    Why do you think the beak is shaped like that?’

    Then she saw what she was supposed to be understanding: Why did one
    child see this and the other that? Why did it sometimes need several
    children to see everything about a stone or a bird or a person?

    When confronting something which may be either a windmill or an evil
    giant, what question should you be asking?

    There are some who ask, "If we do nothing, and that is an evil giant,
    can we afford to be wrong?" These people consider themselves to be
    brave and vigilant.

    Some ask "If we attack it wrongly, can we afford to pay to replace a
    windmill?" These people consider themselves cautious and pragmatic.

    Still others ask, "With the cost of being wrong so high in either
    case, shouldn't we always definitively answer the 'windmill vs. giant'
    question before we act?" And those people consider themselves
    objective and wise.

    But only a tiny few will ask, "Isn't the fact that we're giving equal
    consideration to the existence of evil giants and windmills a warning
    sign of insanity in ourselves?"

    friendship or enmity. Their content did not matter. Friends agreed
    with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with
    enemies, in order to express enmity. The ideas Earthlings held didn’t

On the error of failing to appreciate your opponents three-dimensionality:

    They had cliche answers but only to their self-created straw-men. To
    exaggerate only slightly, they had never talked to anyone who really
    believed, and had thought deeply about, views drastically different
    from their own. As a result, when they heard real arguments instead of
    caricatures, they had no answers, only amazement that such views could
    be expressed by someone who had the external characteristics of being
    a member of the intellectual community, and that such views could be
    defended with apparent cogency. Never have I been more impressed with
    the advice I once received: "You cannot be sure that you are right

    The man in the carriage then replied in a loud voice, “I need to go to

    “You are going the wrong way. The state of Chu is in the south, how
    come you are going to to the north?”

    “That’s alright,” The man in the carriage then said, “Can you not see?

    “Your horse is great, but your path is incorrect.”

    “It’s no problem, my carriage is new, it was made just last month.”

    “Your carriage is brand new, but this is not the road one takes to get
    to Chu.”

    “Old Uncle, you don’t know,” and the man in the carriage pointed to
    the suitcase in the back and said, “In that suitcase there’s alot of
    money. No matter how long the road is, I am not afraid.”

    “You have lots of money, but do not forget, The direction which you
    are going is wrong. I can see, you should go back the direction which
    you came from.”

    The man in the carriage heard this and irritated said, “I have already
    been traveling for ten days, how can you tell me to go back from where
    I came?” He then pointed at the carriage driver and said, “Take a
    look, he is very young, and he drives very well, you needn’t worry.

    talking palpable, if popular, nonsense. If he believed that of his own
    life, he would never cross the street, save to visit his doctor or to
    earn money for things necessary to physical survival. He would eat the
    cheapest, most nutritious food he could find and live in one small
    room, saving his income for frequent visits to the best possible
    doctors. He would take no risks, consume no luxuries, and live a long
    life. If you call it living. If a man really believed that other
    people's lives were infinitely valuable, he would live like an
    ascetic, earn as much money as possible, and spend everything not
    absolutely necessary for survival on CARE packets, research into
    presently incurable diseases, and similar charities.

    In fact, people who talk about the infinite value of human life do not
    live in either of these ways. They consume far more than they need to
    support life. They may well have cigarettes in their drawer and a

    “Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the
    best? I will tell you now.” He touched the tip of his little finger
    lightly to his eyelid. “The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart
    of it.

    “Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands
    strange and wonderful, and when they return their captains fetch queer
    animals to the Sealord’s menagerie. Such animals as you have never
    seen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as
    stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging manticores, tigers
    that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with
    scythes for claws. Syrio Forel has seen these things.

    “On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the
    Sealord sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been
    sent away, none could say why. When I came into his presence, he was
    seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of
    his captains had brought the beast to him, from an island beyond the
    sunrise. ‘Have you ever seen her like?’ he asked of me.

    “And to him I said, ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a
    thousand like him,’ and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named
    the first sword.”

    Arya screwed up her face. “I don’t understand.”

    Syrio clicked his teeth together. “The cat was an ordinary cat, no
    more. The others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw.
    How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only
    fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What
    curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed away in kitten
    fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and
    that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?”

    Arya thought about it. “You saw what was there.”

    “Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and
    the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your
    eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your
    nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in

    . . . once upon a time men lived among the giants, who were like
    themselves but far more powerful, and these giants always had a supply
    of bread, fruit, milk, and all that was necessary to sustain life,
    which they must have acquired in ways that cost them little, for they
    would always give away their goods to whoever knew how to please them.
    And the giants would also carry them wherever they wanted to go,
    provided they asked in the proper way. So it came about that men never
    thought of working, nor of walking, nor of building wagons or ships;
    instead they became natural orators, and spent all of their time
    watching the giants, figuring out what would please or displease them,
    smiling at them or imploring them with tears in their eyes; or else
    simply pronouncing the necessary words, which had to be memorized
    exactly, though they had no understanding of the changes of humor that
    would come over the giants, their brusque refusals, or their sudden
    willingness. Now, if some man, in those days, had tried to get
    something for himself by his own industry, they would have laughed him
    to scorn; for the results of his labor would have been puny beside the
    immense provisions the giants had amassed; and besides with one false
    step the giants could easily have crushed those little beginnings of
    labor out of existence. That is why all human wisdom came down to
    knowing how to speak and how to persuade; and, rather than move things
    about with great effort, men chose to learn what words it would take
    to get one of the giants to do their moving. In short, their main
    business, or rather their only business, was to please, and above all
    not to displease, their incomprehensible masters, who seemed
    nevertheless to be charged with nourishing them and housing them and
    transporting them, and who eventually carried out their duties,
    provided they were prayed to. This kind of existence, in which men
    never knew whether they were the masters or the slaves, lasted for a
    long time, so that the habit of asking, of hoping, of counting on
    those stronger than themselves left indelible traces in human nature.
    . . . That is why, as if they were still waiting for the return of the
    giants, men do not forget to pray and make offerings, though no giant
    has ever shown himself . . .

    The tautological emptiness of a Master's Wisdom is exemplified in the
    inherent stupidity of proverbs. Let us engage in a mental experiment
    by way of trying to construct proverbial wisdom out of the
    relationship between terrestrial life, its pleasures, and its Beyond.
    If ones says, "Forget about the afterlife, about the Elsewhere, seize
    the day, enjoy life fully here and now, it's the only life you've
    got!" it sounds deep. If one says exactly the opposite ("Do not get
    trapped in the illusory and vain pleasures of earthly life; money,
    power, and passions are all destined to vanish into thin air - think
    about eternity!"), it also sounds deep. If one combines the two sides
    ("Bring Eternity into your everyday life, live your life on this earth
    as if it is already permeated by Eternity!"), we get another profound
    thought. Needless to add, the same goes for it's inversion: "Do not
    try in vain to bring together Eternity and your terrestrial life,
    accept humbly that you are forever split between Heaven and Earth!"
    If, finally, one simply gets perplexed by all these reversals and
    claims: "Life is an enigma, do not try to penetrate its secrets,
    accept the beauty of its unfathomable mystery!" the result is, again,
    no less profound than its reversal: "Do not allow yourself to be
    distracted by false mysteries that just dissimulate the fact that,
    ultimately, life is very simple - it is what it is, it is simply here
    without reason and rhyme!" Needless to add that, by uniting mystery
    and simplicity, one again obtains a wisdom: "The ultimate,
    unfathomable mystery of life resides in its very simplicity, in the
    simple fact that there is life."

    The Patrician took a sip of his beer. "I have told this to few people,
    gentlemen, and I suspect I never will again, but one day when I was a
    young boy on holiday in Uberwald I was walking along the bank of a
    stream when I saw a mother otter with her cubs. A very endearing
    sight, I'm sure you will agree, and even as I watched, the mother
    otter dived into the water and came up with a plump salmon, which she
    subdued and dragged onto a half-submerged log. As she ate it, while of
    course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to its day
    the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the
    delight of the baby otters who scrambled over themselves to feed on
    the delicacy. One of nature's wonders, gentlemen: mother and children
    dining upon mother and children. And that's when I first learned about
    evil. It is built in to the very nature of the universe. Every world
    spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself,
    it is up to all of us to become his moral superior."

    ...the discovery of computers and the thinking about computers has
    turned out to be extremely useful in many branches of human reasoning.
    For instance, we never really understood how lousy our understanding
    of languages was, the theory of grammar and all that stuff, until we
    tried to make a computer which would be able to understand language.
    We tried to learn a great deal about psychology by trying to
    understand how computers work. There are interesting philosophical
    questions about reasoning, and relationship, observation, and
    measurement and so on, which computers have stimulated us to think
    about anew, with new types of thinking. And all I was doing was hoping
    that the computer-type of thinking would give us some new ideas, if
    any are really needed.

On the difficulties of correctly fine-tuning your signaling:

    I once expressed mild surprise at the presence of a garden gnome in an
    upper-middle-class garden …. The owner of the garden explained that
    the gnome was “ironic”. I asked him, with apologies for my ignorance,
    how one could tell that his garden gnome was supposed to be an ironic
    statement, as opposed to, you know, just a gnome. He rather sniffily
    replied that I only had to look at the rest of the garden for it to be
    obvious that the gnome was a tounge-in-cheek joke.

    But surely, I persisted, garden gnomes are always something of a joke,
    in any garden—I mean, no-one actually takes them seriously or regards
    them as works of art. His response was rather rambling and confused
    (not to mention somewhat huffy), but the gist seemed to be that while
    the lower classes saw gnomes as intrinsically amusing, his gnome was
    amusing only because of its incongruous appearance in a “smart”
    garden. In other words, council-house gnomes were a joke, but his
    gnome was a joke about council-house tastes, effectively a joke about
    class….

    The man’s reaction to my questions clearly defined him as
    upper-middle, rather than upper class. In fact, his pointing out that
    the gnome I had noticed was “ironic” had already demoted him by half a
    class from my original assessment. A genuine member of the upper
    classes would either have admitted to a passion for garden gnomes … or
    said something like “Ah yes, my gnome. I’m very fond of my gnome.” and
    left me to draw my own conclusions.

    Most people don't know the basic scientific facts about

    wealthy people who know nothing about wine end up with cellars that

    not be surprising when wealthy people who know nothing about happiness
    end up with lives that aren't that much happier than anyone else's.

    There is something about practical things that knocks us off our
    philosophical high horses. Perhaps Heraclitus really thought he
    couldn't step in the same river twice. Perhaps he even received tenure
    for that contribution to philosophy. But suppose some other ancient
    had claimed to have as much right as Heraclitus did to an ox
    Heraclitus had bought, on the grounds that since the animal had
    changed, it wasn't the same one he had bought and so was up for grabs.
    Heraclitus would have quickly come up with some ersatz, watered-down
    version of identity of practical value for dealing with property
    rights, oxen, lyres, vineyards, and the like. And then he might have
    wondered if that watered-down vulgar sense of identity might be a
    considerably more valuable concept than a pure and philosophical sort
    of identity that nothing has.

    A lot of outcomes about which we care deeply are not very predictable.
    For example, it is not comforting to members of a graduate school
    admissions committee to know that only 23% of the variance in later
    faculty ratings of a student can be predicted by a unit weighting of
    the student's undergraduate GPA, his or her GRE score, and a measure
    of the student's undergraduate institution selectivity -- but that is
    opposed to 4% based on those committee members' global ratings of the
    applicant. We want to predict outcomes important to us. It is only
    rational to conclude that if one method (a linear model) does not
    predict well, something else may do better. What is not rational -- in
    fact, it's irrational -- is to conclude that this "something else"
    necessarily exists and, in the absence of any positive supporting
    evidence, is intuitive global judgment.

From Thomas Macaulay's 1848 History of England.

    [W]e are under a deception similar to that which misleads the traveler
    in the Arabian desert. Beneath the caravan all is dry and bare; but
    far in advance, and far in the rear, is the semblance of refreshing
    waters... A similar illusion seems to haunt nations through every
    stage of the long progress from poverty and barbarism to the highest
    degrees of opulence and civilization. But if we resolutely chase the
    mirage backward, we shall find it recede before us into the regions of
    fabulous antiquity. It is now the fashion to place the golden age of
    England in times when noblemen were destitute of comforts the want of
    which would be intolerable to a modern footman, when farmers and
    shopkeepers breakfasted on loaves the very sight of which would raise
    a riot in a modern workhouse, when to have a clean shirt once a week
    was a privilege reserved for the higher class of gentry, when men died
    faster in the purest country air than they now die in the most
    pestilential lanes of our towns, and when men died faster in the lanes
    of our towns than they now die on the coast of Guiana.

.................................

    We too shall in our turn be outstripped, and in our turn be envied. It
    may well be, in the twentieth century, that the peasant of Dorsetshire
    may think himself miserably paid with twenty shillings a week; that
    the carpenter at Greenwich may receive ten shillings a day; that
    laboring men may be as little used to dine without meat as they are
    now to eat rye bread; that sanitary police and medical discoveries may
    have added several more years to the average length of human life;
    that numerous comforts and luxuries which are now unknown, or confined
    to a few, may be within the reach of every diligent and thrifty
    workingman. And yet it may then be the mode to assert that the
    increase of wealth and the progress of science have benefited the few
    at the expense of the many, and to talk of the reign of Queen Victoria
    as the time when England was truly merry England, when all classes
    were bound together by brotherly sympathy, when the rich did not grind

    Sometimes you hear philosophers bemoaning the fact that philosophers
    tend not to form consensuses like certain other disciplines do
    (sciences in particular). But there is no great mystery to this. The
    sciences reward consensus-forming as long as certain procedures are
    followed: agreements through experimental verification, processes of
    peer review, etc. Philosophy has nothing like this. Philosophers are
    rewarded for coming up with creative reasons not to agree with other
    people. The whole thrust of professional philosophy is toward
    inventing ways to regard opposing arguments as failure, as long as
    those ways don't exhibit any obvious flaws. However much philosophers
    are interested in the truth, philosophy as a profession is not
    structured so as to converge on it; it is structured so as to have the
    maximal possible divergence that can be sustained given common
    conventions. We are not trained to find ways to come to agree with
    each other; we are trained to find ways to disagree with each other.

    A few years into this book, I was diagnosed as diabetic and received a
    questionnaire in the mail. The insurance carrier stated that diabetics
    often suffer from depression and it was worried about me. One of the
    questions was “Do you think about death?” Yes, I do. “How often?” the
    company wanted to know. “Yearly? Monthly? Weekly? Daily?” And if
    daily, how many times per day? I dutifully wrote in, “About 70 times
    per day.” The next time I saw my internist, she told me the insurer
    had recommended psychotherapy for my severe depression. I explained to
    her why I thought about death all day—merely an occupational
    hazard—and she suggested getting therapy nonetheless. I thought, fine,
    it might help with the research.

    The therapist found me tragically undepressed, and I asked her if she
    could help me design a new life that would maximize the few years that
    I had left. After all, one should have a different life strategy at
    sixty than at twenty. She asked why I thought I was going to die and
    why I had such a great fear of death. I said, I am going to die. It’s
    not a fear; it’s a reality. There must be some behavior that could be
    contraindicated for a man my age but other normally dangerous behavior
    that takes advantage of the fact that I am risking fewer years at
    sixty or sixty-five years of age than I was at twenty or twenty-five
    (such as crimes that carry a life sentence, crushing at age twenty but
    less so at age sixty-five). Surely psychology must have something to
    say on the topic. Turns out, according to my therapist, it does not.
    There was therapy for those with terminal illness, for the bereaved,
    for the about-to-be-bereaved, for professionals who dealt with
    terminal patients, and so on, but there was nothing for people who
    were simply aware that their life would come to a natural end. It
    would seem to me that this is a large, untapped market. The therapist
    advised me not to think about death.

    Unlike statements of fact, which require no further work on our part,
    lies must be continually protected from collisions with reality. When
    you tell the truth, you have nothing to keep track of. The world
    itself becomes your memory, and if questions arise, you can always
    point others back to it. You can even reconsider certain facts and
    honestly change your views. And you can openly discuss your confusion,
    conflicts, and doubts with all comers. In this way, a commitment to
    the truth is naturally purifying of error.

    Two very different attitudes toward the technical workings of
    mathematics are found in the literature. Already in 1761, Leonhard
    Euler complained about isolated results which "are not based on a
    systematic method" and therefore whose "inner grounds seem to be
    hidden." Yet in the 20'th Century, writers as diverse in viewpoint as
    Feller and de Finetti are agreed in considering computation of a
    result by direct application of the systematic rules of probability
    theory as dull and unimaginative, and revel in the finding of some
    isolated clever trick by which one can see the answer to a problem
    without any calculation.

    [...]

    Feller's perception was so keen that in virtually every problem he was
    able to see a clever trick; and then gave only the clever trick. So
    his readers get the impression that:

        Probability theory has no systematic methods; it is a collection
        of isolated, unrelated clever tricks, each of which works on one
        problem but not on the next one.  Feller was possessed of
        superhuman cleverness.  Only a person with such cleverness can
        hope to find new useful results in probability theory.

    Indeed, clever tricks do have an aesthetic quality that we all
    appreciate at once. But we doubt whether Feller, or anyone else, was
    able to see those tricks on first looking at the problem. We solve a
    problem for the first time by that (perhaps dull to some) direct
    calculation applying our systematic rules. After seeing the solution,
    we may contemplate it and see a clever trick that would have led us to
    the answer much more quickly. Then, of course, we have the opportunity
    for gamesmanship by showing others only the clever trick, scorning to
    mention the base means by which we first found.

    Comprehending complex sentences is something that can be done by first

    British philosophy is more detailed and piecemeal than that of the
    Continent; when it allows itself some general principle, it sets to
    work to prove it inductively by examining its various applications.
    Thus Hume, after announcing that there is no idea without an
    antecedent impression, immediately proceeds to consider the following
    objection: suppose you are seeing two shades of colour which are
    similar but not identical, and suppose you have never seen a shade of
    colour intermediate between the two, can you nevertheless imagine such
    a shade? He does not decide the question, and considers that a
    decision adverse to his general principle would not be fatal to him,
    because his principle is not logical but empirical. When--to take a
    contrast--Leibniz wants to establish his monadology, he argues,
    roughly, as follows: Whatever is complex must be composed of simple
    parts; what is simple cannot be extended; therefore everything is
    composed of parts having no extension. But what is not extended is not
    matter. Therefore the ultimate constituents of things are not
    material, and, if not material, then mental. Consequently a table is
    really a colony of souls.

    The difference of method, here, may be characterized as follows: In
    Locke or Hume, a comparatively modest conclusion is drawn from a broad
    survey of many facts, whereas in Leibniz a vast edifice of deduction
    is pyramided upon a pin-point of logical principle. In Leibniz, if the
    principle is completely true and the deductions are entirely valid,
    all is well; but the structure is unstable, and the slightest flaw
    anywhere brings it down in ruins. In Locke or Hume, on the contrary,
    the base of the pyramid is on the solid ground of observed fact, and
    the pyramid tapers upward, not downward; consequently the equilibrium
    is stable, and a flaw here or there can be rectified without total
    disaster.

    One thing I have advocated, without much success, is that children be
    taught social rules (when they are ready) in exactly the same way they
    are taught and teach each other games. The point is not whether the
    rules are right or wrong. Are the rules of 5-card stud poker or
    hopscotch right or wrong? It's that we're playing a certain game here,
    and there are rules to this game just as in any other game. If you
    want to be in the game, then you have to learn how to play it.
    Different groups of people play different games (different rules =
    different game), so if you want to play in different groups, you have
    to learn the games they play. When you develop the levels of
    understanding above the rule level, you'll be able to understand all
    games, and be able to join in anywhere. You won't be stuck knowing how
    to play only one game.

    My problem with selling this idea is that people tend to think that
    their game is the only right one. In fact, being told that they are
    playing a game with arbitrary rules is insulting or frightening. They
    want to believe that the rules they know are the ones that everyone
    ought to play by; they even set up systems of punishment and reward to
    make sure that nobody tries to play a different game. They turn the
    game into something that is deadly serious, and so my idea simply
    seems frivolous instead of liberating.

    Another learning which cost me much to recognize, can be stated in
    four words. The facts are friendly.

    It has interested me a great deal that most psychotherapists,
    especially the psychoanalysts, have steadily refused to make any
    scientific investigation of their therapy, or to permit others to do
    this. I can understand this reaction because I have felt it.
    Especially in our early investigations I can well remember the anxiety
    of waiting to see how the findings came out. Suppose our hypotheses
    were disproved! Suppose we were mistaken in our views! Suppose our
    opinions were not justified! At such times, as I look back, it seems
    to me that I regarded the facts as potential enemies, as possible
    bearers of disaster. I have perhaps been slow in coming to realize
    that the facts are always friendly. Every bit of evidence one can
    acquire, in any area, leads one that much closer to what is true. And
    being closer to the truth can never be a harmful or dangerous or
    unsatisfying thing. So while I still hate to readjust my thinking,
    still hate to give up old ways of perceiving and conceptualizing, yet
    at some deeper level I have, to a considerable degree, come to realize
    that these painful reorganizations are what is known as learning, and
    that though painful they always lead to a more satisfying because
    somewhat more accurate way of seeing life. Thus at the present time
    one of the most enticing areas for thought and speculation is an area
    where several of my pet ideas have not been upheld by the evidence, I
    feel if I can only puzzle my way through this problem that I will find
    a much more satisfying approximation to the truth. I feel sure the
    facts will be my friends.

    Human suffering has been caused because too many of us cannot grasp
    that words are only tools for our use, and that the mere presence in

    Every time that a man who is not an absolute fool presents you with a
    question he considers very problematic after giving it careful
    thought, distrust those quick answers that come to the mind of someone
    who has considered it only briefly or not at all. These answers are
    usually simplistic views lacking in consistency, which explain

    Therefore, the first and most important duty of philosophy is to test
    impressions, choosing between them and only deploying those that have
    passed the test. You know how, with money--an area where we believe
    our interest to be at stake--we have developed the art of assaying,
    and considerable ingenuity has gone into developing a way to test if
    coins are counterfeit, involving our senses of sight, smell, hearing,
    and touch. The assayer will let the denarius drop and listen intently
    to its ring; and he is not satisfied to listen just once: after
    repeated listenings he practically acquires a musician's subtle ear.
    It is a measure of the effort we are prepared to expend to guard
    against deception when accuracy is at a premium.

    When it comes to our poor mind, however, we can't be bothered; we are
    satisfied accepting any and all impressions, because here the loss we
    suffer is not obvious. If you want to know just how little concerned
    you are about things good and bad, and how serious about things
    indifferent, compare your attitude to going blind with your attitude
    about being mentally in the dark. You will realize, I think, how
    inappropriate your values really are.

How a game theorist buys a car:

    "Hello, my name is Bruce Bueno de Mesquita. I plan to buy the
    following car [list the exact model and features] today at five P.M. I
    am calling all of the dealerships within a fifty-mile radius of my
    home and I am telling each of them what I am telling you. I will come
    in and buy the car today at five P.M. from the dealer who gives me the
    lowest price. I need to have the all-in price, including taxes, dealer
    prep [I ask them not to prep the car and not charge me for it, since
    dealer prep is little more than giving you a washed car with plastic
    covers and paper floormats removed, usually for hundreds of dollars],
    everything, because I will make out the check to your dealership
    before I come and will not have another check with me."

-- The Predictioneer's Game, page 7.

Other car-buying tips from Bueno de Mesquita, in case you're about to buy
a car:

    * Figure out exactly what car you want to buy by searching online
    * before making any contact with dealerships.

    * Don't be afraid to purchase a car from a distant dealership--the
    * manufacturer provides the warranty, not the dealer.

    * Be sure to tell each dealer you will be sharing the price they quote
    * you with subsequent dealers.

    * Don't take shit from dealers who tell you "you can't buy a car over
    * the phone" or do anything other than give you their number. If a
    * dealer is stonewalling, make it quite clear that you're willing to
    * get what you want elsewhere.

    * Arrive at the lowest-price dealer just before 5:00 PM to close the
    * deal.  In the unlikely event that the dealer changes their terms, go
    * for the next best price.

    The story of the Disobedi-Ant is very short. It refused to believe

    Coincidentally enough, so went the reasoning of all its colony-mates.

    Among a great many other things that chess teaches you is to control
    the initial excitement you feel when you see something that looks
    good. It trains you to think before grabbing, and to think just as
    objectively when you're in trouble. When you're making a film you have
    to make most of your decisions on the run, and there is a tendency to
    always shoot from the hip. It takes more discipline than you might
    imagine, to think, even for thirty seconds, in the noisy, confusing,
    high-pressure atmosphere of a film set. But a few seconds' thought can
    often prevent a serious mistake being made about something that looks
    good at first glance. With respect to films, chess is more useful in
    preventing you from making mistakes than giving you ideas. Ideas come
    spontaneously and the discipline required to evaluate and put them to
    use tends to be the real work.

During the discussion of Pranknet on Slashdot about a month ago, I saw
this comment. It reminded me of our discussions about Newcomb's problem
and superrationality.

        I also disagree that our society is based on mutual trust. Volumes
        and volumes of laws backed up by lawyers, police, and jails show
        otherwise.

    That's called selection/observation bias. You're looking at only one
    side of the coin.

    I've lived in countries where there's a lot less trust than here. The
    notion of returning an opened product to a store and getting a full
    refund is based on trust (yes, there's a profit incentive, and some
    people do screw the retailers [and the retailers their customers --
    SB], but the system works overall). In some countries I've been to,
    this would be unfeasible: Almost everyone will try to exploit such a
    retailer.

    When a storm knocks out the electricity and the traffic lights stop
    working, I've always seen everyone obeying the rules. I doubt it's
    because they're worried about cops. It's about trust that the other
    drivers will do likewise. Simply unworkable in other places I've lived
    in.

    I've had neighbors whom I don't know receive UPS/FedEx packages for
    me. Again, trust. I don't think they're afraid of me beating them up.

    There are loads of examples. Society, at least in the US, is fairly
    nice and a lot of that has to do with a common trust.

    Which is why someone exploiting that trust is a despised person.

    He who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense.

-- John McCarthy, on mainstream environmentalism.

As someone who regularly gets into arguments about this, I can say that
he's definitely right; you wouldn't believe the amount of nonsense that
can be disposed of simply by looking up the relevant numbers and doing a
minute's worth of easy arithmetic.

For example, I've heard some people recently claiming that a combination
of solar photovoltaics, electrolysis to produce hydrogen, and these new
Bloom box fuel cells are cheaper than nuclear fission. Look up the costs
of solar farms; about $3 per peak watt. Their average power output is
less; we can very optimistically assume that they run at 20% of capacity
on average. Efficiency losses from electrolysis and fuel cells are about
50%. Putting it all together, this would cost about $30 per watt of
average power delivered. Not including the cost of the fuel cells.

A little googling will show that the total cost of building two new AP1000
reactors in Georgia is about $14 billion, and they average at least 93% of
their peak power, and transmission line losses bring their average power
delivered to about 1000 MW each. So their cost is about $7 per watt of
average power delivered, or about 23% the cost of solar.

There's a lot of extremely harmful bullshit out there, and defeating most
of it doesn't take any advanced techniques; it just takes a willingness to
look up some relevant numbers and do a bit of arithmetic.

    Sometimes, apparently rational self-interested strategies turn out (as

    defeat for rationality, but it is not. Rationality is saved by its own
    open-endedness. If a strategy of following accepted rules of
    rationality is sometimes self-defeating, this is not the end. We
    revise the rules to take account of this, so producing a higher-order
    rationality strategy. This in turn may fail, but again we go up a

    assured us that it was equally useful in fractions and the higher

    without the fatigue of mental application, would by its introduction

    So, let's say some bros of mine and I have some hand-signals for, you
    know, bro stuff. And one of the signals means, "Oh, shit. Here comes
    that girl! You know. That girl. She's coming." That signal has a
    particular context. Eventually, one of my bros gets tired of sloppy
    use of the signal, and sets about laying out specifically what
    situations make a girl that girl. If I used the signal in a
    close-but-not-quite context, he'd handle it and then pull me aside and
    say, "I know she and I had that thing that one time, but we never...
    well, it wasn't quite THAT. You know? So that signal, it freaked me
    out, because I thought it had to be someone else. Make sure you're
    using it properly, okay?" And I'd be like, "Bro. Got it."

    Another friend of mine, he recognizes the sorts of situations we use
    the signal in have a common thread, so he begins using the hand signal
    for other situations, any situation that has the potential for both
    danger and excitement. So if someone invites us to this real sketchy
    bar, he'll give me the signal - "This could be bad. But what if it's
    not?" And I'd respond, "I see what you did there."

    Maybe you see where this is going. We're hanging out one day, and some
    guy suggests we crash some party. Bro #2 signals, and bro #1 freaks
    out, looking around. And then he's like, "OH FUCK I HAVE TO CALL HER."
    And #2 says, "No, dude, there's no one coming. I just meant, this is
    like one of those situations, you know?" And they're pissed at each

    You might expect that, having learned of the existence of immortal
    life, man would dedicate colossal resources to learning how the
    immortal jellyfish performs its trick. You might expect that biotech
    multinationals would vie to copyright its genome; that a vast
    coalition of research scientists would seek to determine the
    mechanisms by which its cells aged in reverse; that pharmaceutical
    firms would try to appropriate its lessons for the purposes of human
    medicine; that governments would broker international accords to
    govern the future use of rejuvenating technology.

    Economists essentially have a sophisticated lack of understanding of
    economics, especially macroeconomics. I know it sounds ridiculous. But
    the reason why I tell people they should study economics is not so
    they’ll know something at the end—because I don’t think we know
    much—but because we’re good at thinking. Economics teaches you to
    think things through. What you see a lot of times in economics is
    disdain for other's lack of thinking. You have to think about the
    ramifications of policies in the short run, the medium run, and the
    long run. Economists think they’re good at doing that, but they’re
    good at doing that in the sense that they can write down a model that
    will help them think about it—not in terms of empirically knowing what
    the answers are. And we have gotten so enamored of thinking things
    through that the fact that we don’t know anything needs to bother us
    more. So, yes, it’s true that the average guy on the street doesn’t
    understand economics, and it’s also true that we don’t understand
    economics. We just have a more sophisticated lack of understanding
    than the guy on the street.

    Maybe that was a childish idea of what getting older was about. Maybe

    the word "innocent" does not mean "naive," it means "not guilty."

    Children do small evils to each other, schoolyard fights and insults,

    In the wake of such suffering, there is no way to adequately explain
    the tragedy. Yet the seemingly random nature of the mass deaths has
    made them even harder for the survivors to understand.

    "In a situation like this, it's only natural to want to assign blame,"
    said Dr. Frederick MacDougal of the National Center for Infectious
    Diseases, who recently lost a third cousin to a degenerative nerve
    disorder. "But the disturbing thing about this case is that no one
    factor is at fault. People are dying for such a wide range of
    reasons--gunshot wounds, black-lung disease, falls down elevator
    shafts--that we have been unable to isolate any single element as the
    cause."

    "No one simple explanation can encompass the enormous scope of this
    problem," MacDougal added. "And that's very difficult for most people
    to process psychologically."

    [...]

    Meanwhile, as the world continues to grapple with this seemingly
    unstoppable threat, the deaths--and the sorrow, fear and pain they
    have wrought--continue.

    News flash, dearies: there’s lots of areas of life that aren’t

    Here is a hand. How do I know? Look closely, asshole, it's clearly a
    hand.

    Look, if you really insist on doubting that here is a hand, or
    anything else, there's nothing really I can say to convince you
    otherwise. What the tits would the world even look like if this
    weren't a hand? What sort of system is your doubt endorsing? After
    all, you can't just say "It's not true that here is a hand." You have
    to be endorsing some other picture of the world. [...]

    So it turns out when I say things like "Here is a hand" I'm not really
    making a claim about the world, I'm laying down some rules for
    discussion. If you doubt there's a hand here, then fuck you and that's
    all there is to it. We can't really talk about anything now, because
    we can't even agree on something as simple as a goddamn hand. When we
    all agree here is a hand, then we can go about discussing our world in
    meaningful ways. Skepticism just undermines a foundation and replaces
    it with nothing; it[']s paralyzing. The grounds for such radical
    skepticism don't exist; it presupposes and relies on the very
    certainty it tries to undermine.

    This is more practical than you realize. There are people who actually
    believe that the world is only 6,000 years old. What the fuck, right?
    But if you've ever talked with one of them, you know that they're
    fucking impossible to have what you consider a 'reasonable' discussion
    with. It's not like they don't have answers for everything, it[']s
    just that those answers don't make any fucking sense to you. It[']s
    the sort of gibberish that makes you want to scream. The problem is
    that you don't even play the game by the same goddamn rules. You're
    both certain of your positions, because those positions are logically
    derived from the worldview each of you endorses as your starting
    point, and you both look at each other's foundations and say,
    "Seriously, what the fuck are you talking about?" You don't even know
    how you would go about convincing them that you're right and they're
    wrong; you don't even agree on a method by which to do that.

    If you flew to some part of the world where they'd never heard of an
    airplane or even a bird, how the fuck could you convince them you
    flew? They don't even know what that means. They would have all sorts
    of questions, and would consider your answers nonsensical or magical.
    When a non-believer is told that God exists, he reacts in the same
    way; also, a believer when he is told there is no God.

    So everything we believe about the world is built on some sort of
    foundation. Sure, that foundation can change, but there is always
    something there at the base, and it is that base that enables us to
    talk about the world. Not everyone has the same base you do, and that
    has to be okay. Just know that some of your beliefs are just as
    unsupported as everyone else's. It's just the way it is, bro.

Just saw on reddit a perfect accidental metaphor: jakeredfield posted this
in r/gaming:

    For the people that have no played Portal yet, be warned, there may be
    spoilers up ahead for you.

    So anyway, I am a huge fan of Portal, I love everything about the
    game. I bought it upon release and have played through it multiple
    times. My friends aren't as big of gamers as me so it took them some
    time to get their hands on Portal. My one friend didn't have a
    computer capable of running Portal so I let him play on mine.

    I pulled up a chair besides him and eagerly watched him play then
    entire time. He loved the game. I expected him to. It's an awesome
    game. But here comes the WTF part...(SPOILERS AHEAD)

    He go to the part at the last puzzle, right before GlaDOS tries to
    kill you in the fire. So then, my friend is like, "Oh, so it's one of
    those games where you die at the end. Haha, it was a good game." And
    then he immediately shuts it down. I just sat there. Shocked. In awe.
    I couldn't believe what I just saw. He turns to me and goes, "Good
    game, I'd play that again."

    This is the part where I just hit him and yell, "IT WASN'T OVER YET!"
    He was so confused. He loaded it back up to that part and couldn't
    figure it out. I then pointed it out to him what he needed to do from
    there. He eventually fully finished the game.

    Imagine what would have happened if I wasn't there? How many other
    people do you think only experienced the game up to this part, because
    they didn't have someone tell them?

What makes it even more perfect is this reply by Aleitheo:

    So rather than try to see if he could live or even just die in the
    fire he turned off the game before he even saw the "ending"?

    Often a person uses some folk proverb to explain a behavioral event
    even though, on an earlier occasion, this same person used a directly
    contradictory folk proverb to explain the same type of event. For
    example, most of us have heard or said, “look before you leap.” Now
    there’s a useful, straightforward bit of behavioral advice—except that
    I vaguely remember admonishing on occasion, “he who hesitates is
    lost.” And “absence makes the heart grow fonder” is a pretty clear
    prediction of an emotional reaction to environmental events. But then
    what about “out of sight, out of mind”? And if “haste makes waste,”
    why do we sometimes hear that “time waits for no man”? How could the
    saying “two heads are better than one” not be true? Except that “too
    many cooks spoil the broth.” If I think “it’s better to be safe than
    sorry,” why do I also believe “nothing ventured, nothing gained”? And
    if “opposites attract,” why do “birds of a feather flock together”? I
    have counseled many students to “never to put off until tomorrow what
    you can do today.” But I hope my last advisee has never heard me say
    this, because I just told him, “cross that bridge when you come to
    it.”

    The enormous appeal of clichés like these is that, taken together as
    implicit “explanations” of behavior, they cannot be refuted. No matter
    what happens, one of these explanations will be cited to cover it. No
    wonder we all think we are such excellent judges of human behavior and
    personality. We have an explanation for anything and everything that
    happens. Folk wisdom is cowardly in the sense that it takes no risk
    that it might be refuted.

(2013), 14.

ETA: Should have included the subsequent paragraph:

    That folk wisdom is “after the fact” wisdom, and that it actually is
    useless in a truly predictive sense, is why sociologist Duncan Watts
    titled one of his books: Everything Is Obvious—Once You Know the
    Answer (2011). Watts discusses a classic paper by Lazarsfeld (1949) in
    which, over 60 years ago, he was dealing with the common criticism
    that “social science doesn’t tell us anything that we don’t already
    know.” Lazarsfeld listed a series of findings from a massive survey of
    600,000 soldiers who had served during World War II; for example, that
    men from rural backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of
    service than soldiers from city backgrounds. People tend to find all
    of the survey results to be pretty obvious. In this example, for
    instance, people tend to think it obvious that rural men would have
    been used to harsher physical conditions and thus would have adapted
    better to the conditions of military life. It is likewise with all of
    the other findings—people find them pretty obvious. Lazarsfeld then
    reveals his punchline: All of the findings were the opposite of what
    was originally stated. For example, it was actually the case that men
    from city backgrounds were in better spirits during their time of
    service than soldiers from rural backgrounds. The last part of the
    learning exercise is for people to realize how easily they would have
    explained just the opposite finding. In the case of the actual
    outcome, people tend to explain it (when told of it first) by saying
    that they expected it because city men are used to working in crowded
    conditions and under hierarchical authority. They never realize how
    easily they would have concocted an explanation for exactly the
    opposite finding.

    The mere fact that it is possible to frame a question does not make it
    legitimate or sensible to do so. There are many things about which you
    can ask, "What is its temperature?" or "What color is it?" but you may
    not ask the temperature question or the color question of, say,
    jealousy or prayer. Similarly, you are right to ask the "Why" question
    of a bicycle's mudguards or the Kariba Dam, but at the very least you
    have no right to assume that the "Why" question deserves an answer
    when posed about a boulder, a misfortune, Mt. Everest, or the

A fable:

    In Persia many centuries ago, the Sufi mullah or holy man Nasruddin
    was arrested after preaching in the great square in front of the
    Shah's palace. The local clerics had objected to Mullah Nasruddin's
    unorthodox teachings, and had demanded his arrest and execution as a
    heretic. Dragged by palace guards to the Shah's throne room, he was
    sentenced immediately to death.

    As he was being taken away, however, Nasruddin cried out to the Shah:
    "O great Shah, if you spare me, I promise that within a year I will
    teach your favourite horse to sing!"

    The Shah knew that Sufis often told the most outrageous fables, which
    sounded blasphemous to many Muslims but which were nevertheless
    intended as lessons to those who would learn. Thus he had been tempted
    to be merciful, anyway, despite the demands of his own religious
    advisors. Now, admiring the audacity of the old man, and being a
    gambler at heart, he accepted his proposal.

    The next morning, Nasruddin was in the royal stable, singing hymns to
    the Shah's horse, a magnificent white stallion. The animal, however,
    was more interested in his oats and hay, and ignored him. The grooms
    and stablehands all shook their heads and laughed at him. "You old
    fool", said one. "What have you accomplished by promising to teach the
    Shah's horse to sing? You are bound to fail, and when you do, the Shah
    will not only have you killed - you'll be tortured as well, for
    mocking him!"

    Nasruddin turned to the groom and replied: "On the contrary, I have
    indeed accomplished much. Remember, I have been granted another year
    of life, which is precious in itself. Furthermore, in that time, many
    things can happen. I might escape. Or I might die anyway. Or the Shah
    might die, and his successor will likely release all prisoners to
    celebrate his accession to the throne".

    "Or...". Suddenly, Nasruddin smiled. "Or, perhaps, the horse will
    learn to sing".

The original source of this fable seems to be lost to time.

    It is now clear to us what, in the year 1812, was the cause of the
    destruction of the French army. No one will dispute that the cause of
    the destruction of Napoleon's French forces was, on the one hand,
    their advance late in the year, without preparations for a winter
    march, into the depths of Russia, and, on the other hand, the
    character that the war took on with the burning of Russian towns and
    the hatred of the foe aroused in the Russian people. But then not only
    did no one foresee (what now seems obvious) that this was the only way
    that could lead to the destruction of an army of eight hundred
    thousand men, the best in the world and led by the best generals, in
    conflict with a twice weaker Russian army, inexperienced and led by
    inexperienced generals; not only did no one foresee this, but all
    efforts on the part of the Russians were constantly aimed at hindering
    the one thing that could save Russia, and, on the part of the French,
    despite Napoleon's experience and so-called military genius, all
    efforts were aimed at extending as far as Moscow by the end of summer,

    I have met people who exaggerate the differences [between the morality
    of different cultures], because they have not distinguished between
    differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For
    example, one man said to me, "Three hundred years ago people in
    England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule
    of Human Nature or Right Conduct?" But surely the reason we do not
    execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we
    did-if we really thought that there were people going about who had
    sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him
    in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or
    drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if
    anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy quislings did.
    There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is
    simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge
    not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing
    them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man

    What makes the elephant disappear is the movement of the wand and the

    In the autumn of 1939, Ludwig Wittgenstein and his young Cambridge
    student and friend Norman Malcolm were walking along the river when
    they saw a newspaper vendor's sign announcing that the Germans had
    accused the British government of instigating a recent attempt to
    assassinate Hitler. When Wittgenstein remarked that it wouldn't
    surprise him at all if it were true, Malcolm retorted that it was
    impossible because "the British were too civilized and decent to
    attempt anything so underhand, and . . . such an act was incompatible
    with the British 'national character'." Wittgenstein was furious. Some
    five years later, he wrote to Malcolm:

        "Whenever I thought of you I couldn't help thinking of a
        particular incident which seemed to me very important. . . . you
        made a remark about 'national character' that shocked me by its
        primitiveness. I then thought: what is the use of studying
        philosophy if all that it does for you is to enable you to talk
        with some plausibility about some abstruse questions of logic,
        etc., if it does not improve your thinking about the important
        questions of everyday life, if it does not make you more
        conscientious than any . . . journalist in the use of the
        DANGEROUS phrases such people use for their own ends."

    Suppose we find a society which lacks our understanding of human
    physiology, and that speaks a language just like English, except for
    one curious family of idioms. When they are tired they talk of being
    beset by fatigues, of having mental fatigues, muscular fatigues,
    fatigues in the eyes and fatigues of the the spirit. Their sports lore
    contains such maxims as 'too many fatigues spoils your aim' and 'five
    fatigues in the legs are worth ten in the arms'. When we encounter
    them and tell them of our science, they want to know what fatigues
    are. They have been puzzling over such questions as whether
    numerically the same fatigue can come and go and return, whether
    fatigues have a definite location in matter and space and time,
    whether fatigues are identical with some physical states or processes
    or events in their bodies, or are made of some sort of stuff. We can
    see that they are off to a bad start with these questions, but what
    should we tell them? One thing we can tell them is that there simply
    are no such things as fatigues - they have a confused ontology. We can
    expect them to retort: 'You don't think there are fatigues? Run around
    the block a few times and you'll know better! There are many things
    your science might teach us, but the non-existence of fatigues isn't

    “Why do you read so much?”

    Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a
    few feet away, regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger
    and said, “Look at me and tell me what you see.”

    The boy looked at him suspiciously. “Is this some kind of trick? I see
    you. Tyrion Lannister.”

    Tyrion sighed. “You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What
    you see is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?”

    “Fourteen,” the boy said.

    “Fourteen, and you’re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short
    and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to
    keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be
    interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are
    strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman.
    Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold
    me to some slaver’s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of
    Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are
    expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years.
    My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life
    is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king and my
    repulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the
    honor of my House, wouldn’t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be
    too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to
    think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of
    my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has
    his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind… and a
    mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its

    After I spoke at the 2005 "Mathematics and Narrative" conference in
    Mykonos, a suggestion was made that proofs by contradiction are the
    mathematician's version of irony. I'm not sure I agree with that: when
    we give a proof by contradiction, we make it very clear that we are
    discussing a counterfactual, so our words are intended to be taken at
    face value. But perhaps this is not necessary. Consider the following
    passage.

        There are those who would believe that every polynomial equation
        with integer coefficients has a rational solution, a view that
        leads to some intriguing new ideas. For example, take the equation
        x² - 2 = 0. Let p/q be a rational solution. Then (p/q)² - 2 = 0,
        from which it follows that p² = 2q². The highest power of 2 that
        divides p² is obviously an even power, since if 2^k is the highest
        power of 2 that divides p, then 2^2k is the highest power of 2
        that divides p². Similarly, the highest power of 2 that divides
        2q² is an odd power, since it is greater by 1 than the highest
        power that divides q². Since p² and 2q² are equal, there must
        exist a positive integer that is both even and odd. Integers with
        this remarkable property are quite unlike the integers we are
        familiar with: as such, they are surely worthy of further study.

    I find that it conveys the irrationality of √2 rather forcefully. But
    could mathematicians afford to use this literary device? How would a
    reader be able to tell the difference in intent between what I have
    just written and the following superficially similar passage?

        There are those who would believe that every polynomial equation
        has a solution, a view that leads to some intriguing new ideas.
        For example, take the equation x² + 1 = 0. Let i be a solution of
        this equation. Then i² + 1 = 0, from which it follows that i² =
        -1. We know that i cannot be positive, since then i² would be
        positive. Similarly, i cannot be negative, since i² would again be
        positive (because the product of two negative numbers is always
        positive). And i cannot be 0, since 0² = 0. It follows that we
        have found a number that is not positive, not negative, and not
        zero. Numbers with this remarkable property are quite unlike the
        numbers we are familiar with: as such, they are surely worthy of
        further study.

    “The goal of the future is full unemployment, so we can play. That’s
    why we have to destroy the present politico-economic system.” This may
    sound like the pronouncement of some bong-smoking anarchist, but it
    was actually Arthur C. Clarke, who found time between scuba diving and
    pinball games to write “Childhood’s End” and think up communications
    satellites. My old colleague Ted Rall recently wrote a column
    proposing that we divorce income from work and give each citizen a
    guaranteed paycheck, which sounds like the kind of lunatic notion
    that’ll be considered a basic human right in about a century, like
    abolition, universal suffrage and eight-hour workdays. The Puritans
    turned work into a virtue, evidently forgetting that God invented it
    as a punishment.

    Anyone who values truth should stop worshipping reason. We all need to
    take a cold hard look at the evidence and see reasoning for what it
    is. ... [M]ost of the bizarre and depressing research findings [about
    cognitive biases] make perfect sense once you see reasoning as having
    evolved not to help us find the truth but to help us engage in
    arguments, persuasion, and manipulation in the context of discussions
    with other people.

    I'm not saying we should all stop reasoning and go with our gut
    feelings. Gut feelings are sometimes better guides than reasoning for
    making consumer choices and interpersonal judgments, but they are
    often disastrous as a basis for public policy, science, and law.
    Rather, what I'm saying is that we must be wary of any /individual/'s
    ability to reason. We should see each individual as being limited,
    like a neuron. A neuron is really good at one thing: summing up the
    stimulation coming into its dendrites to 'decide' whether to fire a
    pulse along its axon. A neuron by itself isn't very smart. But if you
    put neurons together in the right way you get a brain; you get an
    emergent system that is much smarter and more flexible than a single
    neuron.

    In the same way, each individual reasoner is really good at one thing:
    finding evidence to support the position he or she already holds,
    usually for intuitive reasons. We should not expect individuals to
    produce good, open-minded, truth-seeking reasoning, particularly when
    self-interest or reputational concerns are in play. But if you put
    individuals together in the right way, such that some individuals can
    use their reasoning powers to disconfirm the claims of others, and all
    individuals feel some common bond or shared fate that allows them to
    interact civilly, you can create a group that ends up producing good
    reasoning as an emergent property of the social system. This is why
    it's so important to have intellectual and ideological diversity
    within any group or institution whose goal is to find truth.

    A person is said to exhibit rational irrationality when it is
    instrumentally rational for him to be epistemically irrational. An
    instrumentally rational person chooses the best strategies to achieve
    his goals. An epistemically irrational person ignores and evades
    evidence against his beliefs, holds his beliefs without evidence or
    with only weak evidence, has contradictions in his thinking, employs
    logical fallacies in belief formation, and exhibits characteristic
    epistemic vices such as closed-mindedness. Epistemically irrational
    political beliefs can reinforce one’s self-image; boost one’s
    self-esteem; make one feel noble, smart, superior, safe, or
    comfortable; and can help achieve conformity with the group and thus
    facilitate social acceptance. Thus, epistemic irrationality can be
    instrumentally rational.

    If I falsely believe the road I am crossing is free of cars, I might
    die. So I have a strong incentive to form beliefs about the road in a
    rational way. However, if I falsely believe that import quotas are
    good for the economy, this has no directly harmful effects. (On the
    contrary, the belief can have significant instrumental value. It might
    make me feel patriotic; serve my xenophobia; serve as an outlet to
    rationalize, sublimate, or redirect racist attitudes; or help me
    pretend to have solidarity with union workers.) … Epistemic
    rationality is hard and takes self-discipline.

    When it comes to politics, individuals have every incentive to indulge
    their irrational impulses. Demand for irrational beliefs is like
    demand for most other goods. The lower the cost, the more will be
    demanded. The cost to the typical voter of voting in epistemically
    irrational ways is nearly zero. The cost of overcoming bias and
    epistemic irrationality is high. The psychological benefit of this
    irrationality is significant. Thus, voters demand a high amount of
    epistemic irrationality.

    On some pitch black mornings, hearing what I knew was a cold wind
    howling outside, I might think, "Well, it is certainly comfortable in
    this bed, and maybe it wouldn't hurt if I just skipped practicing
    to-day." But my response to this was not to draw on something called
    will power, to insult or threaten myself, but to take a longer look at
    my life, to extend my vision, to think about the whole of my
    experience, to reconnect present and future, and quite specifically,
    to ask myself, "Do you like playing the cello or not? Would you like
    to play it better or not?" When I put the matter this way I could see
    that I enjoyed playing the cello more than I enjoyed staying in bed.
    So I got up. If, as sometimes happened or happens, I do stay in bed,
    not sleeping, not really thinking, but just not getting up, it is not
    because will power is weak but because I have temporarily become

    To sum up: it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone, to believe

    If a man, holding a belief which he was taught in childhood or
    persuaded of afterwards, keeps down and pushes away any doubts which
    arise about it in his mind, purposely avoids the reading of books and
    the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards
    as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without
    disturbing it--the life of that man is one long sin against mankind.

    ... "But," says one, "I am a busy man; I have no time for the long

    One of the most serious problems with modern "management" is that the
    incentives are all wrong. Imagine that I hire a programmer and pay him
    by the line of code. This idea has been so thoroughly debunked that it
    is nearly impossible to write out the consequences without sounding
    cliché. Yet it happens all the time: Companies promote "Architects"
    who are evaluated by the weight of their "architecture." The result is
    stultifying and demoralizing. The architect does not work to
    facilitate the programmer's work, he works to produce evidence of his
    contribution in the form of frameworks, standards, and software
    process.

    So, how are most managers evaluated? By the amount of "managing" they
    do, as measured by the amount of process they impose on their team.
    Evaluating a manager by the amount of managing they do is exactly the
    same thing as evaluating a programmer by the amount of code they
    write. And it produces results like you describe, where the manager
    works to produce evidence of their management in the form of processes
    and decisions from the top down, rather than facilitating the work
    actually being done.

    People can learn to look you in the eyes even when they're lying to

    up there. If you know what you're looking for, you can still tell. But
    what does it mean if they're looking you in the eyes and they mean it?
    It means that, at least in that moment, they're doing what they really
    believe is right. That's the definition of integrity.

    That part is easy. That's not the surprising thing.

    The surprising thing, to me, was that someone can have integrity and
    still be completely evil. It's kind of obvious in retrospect; the
    super-villain in an action movie can always look the hero in the eye,
    and he always does, just to prove it. He has integrity. Evil with
    integrity is more respectable, somehow, than plain evil. All it takes

    ...some people requested that I be prohibited from studying. One time
    they achieved it through a very holy and simple mother superior who
    believed that studying would get me in trouble with the Inquisition
    and ordered me not to do it. I obeyed her for the three months that
    she was in office in as far as I did not touch a book, but as far as
    absolutely not studying, this was not in my power. [...] Even the
    people I spoke to, and what they said to me, gave rise to thousands of
    reflections. What was the source of all the variety of personality and
    talent I found among them, since they were all one species? [...]
    Sometimes I would pace in front of the fireplace in one of our large
    dormitories and notice that, though the lines of two sides were
    parallel and its ceiling level, to our vision it appears as though the
    lines are inclined toward each other and the ceiling is lower in the
    distance than it is nearby. From this it can be inferred that the
    lines of our vision run straight, but not parallel, to form the figure
    of a pyramid. And I wondered if that was the reason that the ancients
    questioned whether the earth was a sphere or not. Because although it
    seemed so, their vision might have deceived them, showing concave
    shapes where there were none. [...] Once I saw two girls playing with
    a top, and hardly had I seen the movement and the shape when I began,
    in my insane way, to consider the easy movement of the spherical shape
    and how long the momentum, once established, remained independent of
    its original cause, the distant hand of the girl. Not content with
    this I had flour brought and sprinkled on the floor in order to
    discover whether the spinning top would describe perfect circles or
    not. It turned out that they were not perfect circles but spirals that
    lost their circular shape to the degree that the top lost momentum.

    We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are both
    true and sufficient to explain their appearances.

    To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain,
    and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with
    simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.

Rule II

    Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible,
    assign the same causes.

    As to respiration in a man and in a beast; the descent of stones in
    Europe and in America; the light of our culinary fire and of the sun;
    the reflection of light in the earth, and in the planets.

Rule III

    The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intensification nor
    remission of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies
    within the reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal
    qualities of all bodies whatsoever.

    For since the qualities of bodies are only known to us by experiments,
    we are to hold for universal all such as universally agree with
    experiments; and such as are not liable to diminution can never be
    quite taken away. We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence for
    the sake of dreams and vain fictions of our own devising; nor are we
    to recede from the analogy of Nature, which is wont to be simple, and
    always consonant to itself. . .

Rule IV

    In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions inferred
    by general induction from phenomena as accurately or very nearly true,
    notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be imagined, till
    such time as other phenomena occur, by which they may either be made
    more accurate, or liable to exceptions.

    This rule we must follow, that the argument of induction may not be
    evaded by hypotheses.

    From desert cliff and mountaintop we trace the wide design,

    Strike-slip fault and overthrust and syn and anticline...

    We gaze upon creation where erosion makes it known,

    And count the countless aeons in the banding of the stone.

    Odd, long-vanished creatures and their tracks shells are found;

    Where truth has left its sketches on the slate below the ground.

    The patient stone can speak, if we but listen when it talks.

    Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the rocks.

    There are those who name the stars, who watch the sky by night,

    Seeking out the darkest place, to better see the light.

    Long ago, when torture broke the remnant of his will,

    Galileo recanted, but the Earth is moving still.

    High above the mountaintops, where only distance bars,

    The truth has left its footprints in the dust between the stars.

    We may watch and study or may shudder and deny,

    Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the sky.

    By stem and root and branch we trace, by feather, fang and fur,

    How the living things that are descend from things that were.

    The moss, the kelp, the zebrafish, the very mice and flies,

    These tiny, humble, wordless things--how shall they tell us lies?

    We are kin to beasts; no other answer can we bring.

    The truth has left its fingerprints on every living thing.

    Remember, should you have to choose between them in the strife,

    Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote life.

    And we who listen to the stars, or walk the dusty grade,

    Or break the very atoms down to see how they are made,

    Or study cells, or living things, seek truth with open hand.

    The profoundest act of worship is to try to understand.

    Deep in flower and in flesh, in star and soil and seed,

    The truth has left its living word for anyone to read.

    So turn and look where best you think the story is unfurled.

    Humans wrote the Bible; God wrote the world.

    The Three Virtues of a Programmer:

        Laziness - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce
        overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving
        programs that other people will find useful, and document what you
        wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.

        Impatience - The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy.
        This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs,
        but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.

        Hubris - Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for.
        Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that
        other people won't want to say bad things about.

    Suppose I think, after doing my accounts, that I have a large balance
    at the bank. And suppose you want to find out whether this belief of
    mine is "wishful thinking." You can never come to any conclusion by
    examining my psychological condition. Your only chance of finding out
    is to sit down and work through the sum yourself. When you have
    checked my figures, then, and then only, will you know whether I have
    that balance or not. If you find my arithmetic correct, then no amount
    of vapouring about my psychological condition can be anything but a
    waste of time. If you find my arithmetic wrong, then it may be
    relevant to explain psychologically how I came to be so bad at my
    arithmetic, and the doctrine of the concealed wish will become
    relevant — but only after you have yourself done the sum and
    discovered me to be wrong on purely arithmetical grounds. It is the
    same with all thinking and all systems of thought. If you try to find
    out which are tainted by speculating about the wishes of the thinkers,
    you are merely making a fool of yourself. You must first find out on
    purely logical grounds which of them do, in fact, break down as
    arguments. Afterwards, if you like, go on and discover the
    psychological causes of the error.

    ... People usually don't know why they vote for the candidates they

    something influenced that vote -- let alone how some hypothetical

    ...if you ask voters, it turns out that some will tell you that they

    they'll be less likely, to vote for someone with a Trump endorsement.
    Hey, reporters: don't believe those polls! You can take it as a

    What really matters is:-

        Always try to use the language so as to make quite clear what you
        mean and make sure your sentence couldn't mean anything else.

        Always prefer the plain direct word to the long, vague one. Don't
        implement promises, but keep them.

        Never use abstract nouns when concrete ones will do. If you mean
        "More people died" don't say "Mortality rose."

        In writing. Don't use adjectives which merely tell us how you want
        us to feel about the thing you are describing. I mean, instead of
        telling us a thing was "terrible," describe it so that we'll be
        terrified. Don't say it was "delightful"; make us say "delightful"
        when we've read the description. You see, all those words
        (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying
        to your readers, "Please will you do my job for me."

        Don't use words too big for the subject. Don't say "infinitely"
        when you mean "very"; otherwise you'll have no word left when you
        want to talk about something really infinite.

    ...a good way of thinking about minimalism [about truth] and its
    attractions is to see it as substituting the particular for the
    general. It mistrusts anything abstract or windy. Both the relativist
    and the absolutist are impressed by Pilate's notorious question 'What
    is Truth?', and each tries to say something useful at the same high
    and vertiginous level of generality. The minimalist can be thought of
    turning his back on this abstraction, and then in any particular case
    he prefaces his answer with the prior injunction: you tell me. This
    does not mean, 'You tell me what truth is.' It means, 'You tell me
    what the issue is, and I will tell you (although you will already
    know, by then) what the truth about the issue consists in.' If the
    issue is whether high tide is at midday, then truth consists in high
    tide being at midday... We can tell you what truth amounts to, if you
    first tell us what the issue is.

    There is a very powerful argument for minimalism about truth, due to
    the great logician Gottlob Frege. First, we should notice the
    transparency property of truth. This is the fact that it makes no
    difference whether you say that it is raining, or it is true that it
    is raining, or true that it is true that it is raining, and so on
    forever. But if 'it is true that' introduced some substantial, robust
    property of a judgment, how could this be so? Consider, for example, a
    pragmatism that attempts some equation between truth and utility. Then
    next to the judgment 'it is raining' we might have 'it is useful to
    believe that it is raining.' But these are entirely different things!
    To assess the first we direct our attention to the weather. To assess
    the second we direct our attention to the results of believing
    something about the weather - a very different investigation.

    Let us return to Pilate. Where does minimalism about truth leave him?
    It suggests that when he asked this question, he was distracting
    himself and his audience from his real job, which was to find out
    whether to uphold certain specific historical charges against a
    defendant. Thus, if I am innocent, and I come before a judge, I don't
    want airy generalities about the nature of truth. I want him to find
    that I did not steal the watch if I did not steal the watch. I want
    him to rub his nose in the issue. I want a local judgment about a
    local or specific event, supposed to have happened in a particular
    region of time and space.

    In a society in which the narrow pursuit of material self-interest is
    the norm, the shift to an ethical stance is more radical than many
    people realize. In comparison with the needs of people starving in
    Somalia, the desire to sample the wines of the leading French
    vineyards pales into insignificance. Judged against the suffering of
    immobilized rabbits having shampoos dripped into their eyes, a better
    shampoo becomes an unworthy goal. An ethical approach to life does not
    forbid having fun or enjoying food and wine, but it changes our sense
    of priorities. The effort and expense put into buying fashionable
    clothes, the endless search for more and more refined gastronomic
    pleasures, the astonishing additional expense that marks out the
    prestige car market in cars from the market in cars for people who
    just want a reliable means to getting from A to B, all these become
    disproportionate to people who can shift perspective long enough to
    take themselves, at least for a time, out of the spotlight. If a

    that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps
    rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record
    shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit
    such "punctuated equilibrium," so Richard and I decided to look more
    closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went

(In a thread where people were asked whether or not they had a religious
experience of "feeling God"):

    I had something similar to feeling God, I suppose, except it was in
    essence the exact opposite. I was in a forest one summer, and I looked
    up at the sunlight shining through the leaves, and suddenly it felt
    like I could see each and every individual leaf in the forest and
    trace the path of each photon that poured through them, and I remember
    thinking over and over, in stunned amazement, "the world is
    sufficient. The world is sufficient."

    I'd never thought much about religion before that, but that experience
    made me realize that the material world was entire orders of magnitude
    more beautiful than any of the tawdry religious fantasies people came
    up with, and it felt unspeakably tragic that anyone would ever reject
    this, our most incredible universe, for spiritual pipe-dreams. In a
    way, you might say I felt the lack of god, and it felt like glory.

    The tendency toward generalization doesn’t bother me in an of itself,
    rather, I’m focused on whether the proposition is true. But the
    hypocrisy gets tiresome sometimes, as people will fluidly switch from
    a cognitive style which accepts generalization to one which rejects
    it. A stereotype is often a generalization whose robustness you don’t

    In just fifty years, we've made it shameful to be publicly racist.

    In just ten years, someone who professes to not know how to use the

    The question, then, is how long before we will be ashamed at being

    How long before it's unacceptable to take something at face value? How
    long before you can do your job without understanding the state of the

    Does access to information change the expectation that if you can

    I am reminded of a commentary on logic puzzles of a certain kind; it
    was perhaps in a letter to Martin Gardner, reprinted in one of his
    books. The puzzles are those about getting about on an island where
    each native either always tells the truth or always lies. You reach a
    fork in the road, for example, and a native is standing there, and you
    want to learn from him, with one question, which way leads to the
    village. The “correct” question is “If I asked you if the left way led
    to the village, would you say yes?” But why should the native’s
    concept of lying conform to our own logical ideas? If the native is a
    liar, it means he wants to fool you, and your logical trickery will
    not work. The best you can do is say something like “Did you hear they
    are giving away free beer in the village today?” and see which way the
    native runs. You follow him, even if he says something like “Ugh, I
    hate beer!” since then he probably really is lying.

    Lastly, there is an attitude not unknown in the crisis against which I
    should particularly like to protest. I should address my protest
    especially to those lovers and pursuers of Peace who, very
    short-sightedly, have occasionally adopted it. I mean the attitude
    which is impatient of these preliminary details about who did this or
    that, and whether it was right or wrong. They are satisfied with
    saying that an enormous calamity, called War, has been begun by some
    or all of us; and should be ended by some or all of us. To these
    people this preliminary chapter about the precise happenings must
    appear not only dry (and it must of necessity be the driest part of
    the task) but essentially needless and barren. I wish to tell these
    people that they are wrong; that they are wrong upon all principles of
    human justice and historic continuity: but that they are specially and
    supremely wrong upon their own principles of arbitration and
    international peace.

    These sincere and high-minded peace-lovers are always telling us that
    citizens no longer settle their quarrels by private violence; and that
    nations should no longer settle theirs by public violence. They are
    always telling us that we no longer fight duels; and need no longer
    wage wars. In short, they perpetually base their peace proposals on
    the fact that an ordinary citizen no longer avenges himself with an
    axe. But how is he prevented from revenging himself with an axe? If he
    hits his neighbour on the head with the kitchen chopper, what do we
    do? Do we all join hands, like children playing Mulberry Bush, and say
    "We are all responsible for this; but let us hope it will not spread.
    Let us hope for the happy day when he shall leave off chopping at the
    man's head; and when nobody shall ever chop anything for ever and
    ever." Do we say "Let byegones be byegones; why go back to all the
    dull details with which the business began; who can tell with what
    sinister motives the man was standing there within reach of the
    hatchet?" We do not. We keep the peace in private life by asking for
    the facts of provocation, and the proper object of punishment. We do
    go into the dull details; we do enquire into the origins; we do
    emphatically enquire who it was that hit first. In short we do what I
    have done very briefly in this place.

    The inhabitants of Florence in 1494 or Athens in 404 BCE could be

    they knew nothing of such things as the reach of explanations or the
    power of science or even laws of nature as we understand them, let
    alone the moral and technological progress that was to follow when the
    Enlightenment got under way. At the moment of defeat, it must have

    When I was halfway through my Ph.D. I formulated a hypothesis: The
    proximate challenge that keeps you from graduating is that you have to
    write a thesis. But the ultimate challenge to getting your Ph.D. is
    this: You somehow have to learn to understand, deep down, that all
    your romantic notions about the Ph.D. are bunk, that you will be
    exactly the same person on the day after you get it that you were the
    day before, and that you need to stop waiting for the day when you
    feel like a god and just write something down and get on with life.

    It may take you years to accept this, and it may drive you to drink,
    but after you get to that point you can graduate.

    Only then will you be able to live with the fact that your thesis
    looks like crap to you. Your thesis will always look like crap to you.
    Either you will have figured out absolutely everything and your thesis
    will look incredibly boring to you, because you've moved on, or --
    vastly more likely -- your thesis will look woefully incomplete
    because, geez, there is so much that you couldn't figure out, and
    you're just so stupid!

    Or, most likely of all, you will think both of these things at the
    same time.

    Similarly: Being the world's foremost expert on a particular
    scientific problem is a lot less exciting in real life than it seems
    in the movies. In fact, being on the frontier of science feels like
    being totally, hopelessly lost and confused. Why this came as a

    In prose, the worst thing one can do with words is surrender to them.
    When you think of a concrete object, you think wordlessly, and then,
    if you want to describe the thing you have been visualizing you
    probably hunt about until you find the exact words that seem to fit
    it. When you think of something abstract you are more inclined to use
    words from the start, and unless you make a conscious effort to
    prevent it, the existing dialect will come rushing in and do the job
    for you, at the expense of blurring or even changing your meaning.
    Probably it is better to put off using words as long as possible and
    get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures and sensations.

    Unfortunately, he tested his hunch by palpating the patient's tongue,
    without washing his hands between patients. When patient after patient

    The reason you can't rigidly separate positive from normative
    economics is that you can't rigidly separate claims of fact from
    claims of value in general. Human language is too laden with thick
    concepts that mix the two. The claim that someone is a "slut" or a
    "bitch", for example, melds together factual claims about a woman's
    behavior with a lot of deeply embedded normative concepts about what
    constitutes appropriate behavior for a woman. The claim that financial
    markets are "efficient" is both an effort to describe their operation
    and a way of valorizing them. The idea of a "recession" or "full
    employment" or "potential output" all embed certain ideas about what
    would constitute a normal arrangement of human economic activity (...)
    You could try to rigorously purge your descriptions of the economy of
    anything that vaguely smells of a thick moral concept, but you'd find
    yourself operating with an impoverished vocubulary unable to describe
    human affairs in any kind of reasonable way.

    [Hitler] has grasped the falsity of the hedonistic attitude to life.
    Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all
    "progressive" thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire
    nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view
    of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the
    military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with
    soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a
    substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won’t do.
    Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional
    strength, knows that human beings don’t only want comfort, safety,
    short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common
    sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and
    self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades.

    However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are
    psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life.
    The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarized version of
    Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power
    by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism,
    and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to people "I offer
    you a good time," Hitler has said to them "I offer you struggle,
    danger and death," and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his
    feet.

    The Patrician steepled his hands and looked at Vimes over the top of
    them.

    "Let me give you some advice, Captain," he said.

    "Yes, sir?"

    "It may help you make some sense of the world."

    "Sir."

    "I believe you find life such a problem because you think there are
    the good people and the bad people," said the man. "You're wrong, of
    course. There are, always and only, the bad people, but some of them
    are on opposite sides. "

    He waved his thin hand towards the city and walked over to the window.

    "A great rolling sea of evil," he said, almost proprietorially.
    "Shallower in some places, of course, but deeper, oh, so much deeper
    in others. But people like you put together little rafts of rules and
    vaguely good intentions and say, this is the opposite, this will
    triumph in the end. Amazing!" He slapped Vimes good-naturedly on the
    back.

    "Down there," he said, "are people who will follow any dragon, worship
    any god, ignore any iniquity. All out of a kind of humdrum, everyday
    badness. Not the really high, creative loathesomeness of the great
    sinners, but a sort of mass-produced darkness of the soul. Sin, you
    might say, without a trace of originality. They accept evil not
    because they say yes, but because they don't say no. I'm sorry if this
    offends you,'' he added, patting the captain's shoulder, "but you
    fellows really need us."

    "Yes, sir?" said Vimes quietly.

    "Oh, yes. We're the only ones who know how to make things work. You
    see, the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the
    bad people. And you're good at that, I'll grant you. But the trouble
    is that it's the only thing you're good at. One day it's the ringing
    of the bells and the casting down of the evil tyrant, and the next
    it's everyone sitting around complaining that ever since the tyrant
    was overthrown no-one's been taking out the trash. Because the bad
    people know how to plan. It's part of the specification, you might
    say. Every evil tyrant has a plan to rule the world. The good people
    don't seem to have the knack."

    "Maybe. But you're wrong about the rest!" said Vimes. "It's just
    because people are afraid, and alone-" He paused. It sounded pretty
    hollow, even to him.

    He shrugged. "They're just people," he said. "They're just doing what
    people do. Sir."

    Lord Vetinari gave him a friendly smile. "Of course, of course," he
    said. "You have to believe that, I appreciate. Otherwise you'd go
    quite mad. Otherwise you'd think you're standing on a feather-thin
    bridge over the vaults of Hell. Otherwise existence would be a dark
    agony and the only hope would be that there is no life after death. I
    quite understand."

    (...)

    After a while he made a few pencil annotations to the paper in front
    of him and looked up.

    "I said," he said, "that you may go."

    Vimes paused at the door.

    "Do you believe all that, sir?" he said. "About the endless evil and
    the sheer blackness?"

    "Indeed, indeed," said the Patrician, turning over the page. "It is
    the only logical conclusion."

    "But you get out of bed every morning, sir?"

    "Hmm? Yes? What is your point?"

    "I'd just like to know why, sir."

    "Oh, do go away, Vimes. There's a good fellow."

Long quote to make a simple point, but relevant. (Context: this is from a
Star Wars novel, so it's fiction.)

    A death hollow is a low point where the heavier-than-air toxic gases
    that roll downslope from the volcanoes can pool.

    The corpse of a hundred-kilo tusker lay just within its rim, its snout
    only a meter below the clear air that could have saved it. Other
    corpses littered the ground around it: rot crows and jacunas and other
    small scavengers I didn't recognize, lured to their deaths by the
    jungle's false promise of an easy meal.

    I said something along these lines to Nick. He laughed and called me a
    Balawai fool.

    "There's no false promise," he'd said. "There's no promise at all. The
    jungle doesn't promise. It exists. That's all. What killed those
    little ruskakks wasn't a trap. It was just the way things are."

    Nick says that to talk of the jungle as a person-to give it the
    metaphoric aspect of a creature, any creature-that's a Balawai thing.
    That's part of what gets them killed out here.

    It's a metaphor that shades the way you think: talk of the jungle as a
    creature, and you start treating it like a creature. You start
    thinking you can outsmart the jungle, or trust it, overpower it or
    befriend it, deceive it or bargain with it.

    And then you die.

    "Not because the jungle kills you. You get it? Just because it is what
    it is." These are Nick's words. "The jungle doesn't do anything. It's
    just a place. It's a place where many, many things live... and all of
    them die. Fantasizing about it - pretending it's something it's not -
    is fatal. That's your free life lesson for the day," he told me. "Keep
    it in mind."

    I will.

Edit: The rationality relevance might need some explanation. The way I've

between a task that's achievable but very difficult (and that it therefore
might make sense to spend time/effort on), and a task that is impossible
(and thus is a complete waste of time/effort).

If you spend some time searching for the cat in the dark room, you might
not find it. Is that because finding it is difficult (after all, this is
what you might quite plausibly expect, if you assume that the cat is
there), or because the cat is not there and you're wasting your time?

    Moral language persuades best when opinions are not yet formed, which
    is why writers of children’s literature can get away with saying
    things like, “Mr. Billings was an awful, horrible man with a heart of
    stone.” This sounds like a line from a children’s book because it
    employs persuasive methods that, though appropriate for children,
    would insult the intelligence of most adult readers.

    Most moral discourse is the conversational equivalent of children’s
    literature. Disputants speak to one another—or, rather, at one
    another—as if their interlocutors failed to pay adequate attention on
    the day elementary morality was explained. Unaware of the projective
    nature of value, they marvel at their opponents’ blindness, their
    utter failure to see what is so perfectly obvious. Not knowing what
    else to do, they scold their opponents as if they were children, and
    scold them as if they were belligerent children when they fail to
    respond the first time.

    What to do about this? Take a cue from good writers. Stick to the
    facts. Keep evaluative language to a minimum, and get rid of the most
    overtly judgmental, moralistic language.

    'One day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and
    he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of
    biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that
    he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats
    in the front row, if they would also like a biscuit. A few students
    took a biscuit.

    "Nice biscuit, don't you think," said Korzybski, while he took a 2nd
    one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white
    paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On
    it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words "Dog Cookies."

    The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them
    wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out
    of the lecture hall to the toilet.

    "You see," Korzybski remarked, "I have just demonstrated that people
    don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former
    is often outdone by the taste of the latter."'

I think of this as a rationalist parable and not so much a quote. It has a
lot of personal resonance since I often had dog biscuits with my tea when
I was younger.

On the same theme as the previous one:

    I've begun worshipping the sun for a number of reasons. First of all,
    unlike some other gods I could mention, I can see the sun. It's there
    for me every day. And the things it brings me are quite apparent all
    the time: heat, light, food, a lovely day. There is no mystery, no one
    asks for money, I don't have to dress up, and there is no boring
    pageantry. And interestingly enough, I have found that the prayers I
    offer to the sun and the prayers I formerly offered to "God" are all
    answered at about the same 50-percent rate.

    I believe I am accurate in saying that educators too are interested in

    value. To know who won the battle of Poltava, or when the umpteenth
    opus of Mozart was first performed, may win $64,000 or some other sum
    for the possessor of this information, but I believe educators in
    general are a little embarrassed by the assumption that the
    acquisition of such knowledge constitutes education. Speaking of this
    reminds me of a forceful statement made by a professor of agronomy in
    my freshman year in college. Whatever knowledge I gained in his course
    has departed completely, but I remember how, with World War I as his

    "Because they were hypocrites," Finkle-McGraw said, after igniting his
    calabash and shooting a few tremendous fountains of smoke into the
    air, "the Victorians were despised in the late twentieth century. Many
    of the persons who held such opinions were, of course, guilty of the
    most nefandous conduct themselves, and yet saw no paradox in holding
    such views because they were not hypocrites themselves-they took no
    moral stances and lived by none."

    "So they were morally superior to the Victorians-" Major Napier said,
    still a bit snowed under. "-even though-in fact, because-they had no
    morals at all." There was a moment of silent, bewildered head-shaking
    around the copper table.

    "We take a somewhat different view of hypocrisy," Finkle-McGraw
    continued. "In the late-twentieth-century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite
    was someone who espoused high moral views as part of a planned
    campaign of deception-he never held these beliefs sincerely and
    routinely violated them in privacy. Of course, most hypocrites are not
    like that. Most of the time it's a spirit-is-willing, flesh-is-weak
    sort of thing."

    "That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier
    said, working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in
    espousing that code."

    "Of course not," Finkle-McGraw said. "It's perfectly obvious, really.
    No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct.
    Really, the difficulties involved-the missteps we make along the way
    are what make it interesting. The internal, and eternal, struggle,
    between our base impulses and the rigorous demands of our own moral
    system is quintessentially human. It is how we conduct ourselves in
    that struggle that determines how we may in time be judged by a higher
    power."

    to be these things and were almost entirely blind to the fact that

    institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or
    gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes
    gaily up to it and says, "I don't see the use of this; let us clear it
    away." To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to
    answer: "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you
    clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and
    tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.

    Idealists of all schools, aristocrats and bourgeois, theologians and
    physicians, politicians and moralists, religionists, philosophers, or
    poets, not forgetting the liberal economists - unbounded worshippers
    of the ideal, as we know - are much offended when told that man, with
    his magnificent intelligence, his sublime ideas, and his boundless
    aspirations, is, like all else existing in the world, nothing but
    matter, only a product of vile matter.

    We may answer that the matter of which materialists speak, matter
    spontaneously and eternally mobile, active, productive, matter
    chemically or organically determined and manifested by the properties
    or forces, mechanical, physical, animal, and intelligent, which
    necessarily belong to it - that this matter has nothing in common with
    the vile matter of the idealists. The latter, a product of their false
    abstraction, is indeed a stupid, inanimate, immobile thing, incapable
    of giving birth to the smallest product, a caput mortuum, an ugly
    fancy in contrast to the beautiful fancy which they call God; as the
    opposite of this supreme being, matter, their matter, stripped by that
    constitutes its real nature, necessarily represents supreme
    nothingness.

From Wintersmith, on the ability to notice confusion rather than

    “The important thing,” said Miss Treason, “is to stay the passage of

    are the worst, take it from me.”

    “I don’t think I understand—” Tiffany began.

    “Try not to fart, in a nutshell.”

    “In a nutshell I imagine it would be pretty unpleasant!” said Tiffany
    nervously. She couldn’t believe she was being told this.

    “This is no joking matter,” said Miss Treason. “The human body only
    has so much air in it. You have to make it last. One plate of beans
    can take a year off your life. I have avoided rumbustiousness all my

    gave the bewildered Tiffany a stern look. “Do you understand, child?”

    Tiffany’s mind raced. Everything is a test! “No,” she said. “I’m not a

About the intersection of math and politics through the mind of a child,
Bob Murphy relates this story about his six-year-old son Clark:

    Clark: Daddy why can’t there be a biggest number?

    Bob: Because no matter how big a number is, there is always a bigger
    number.

    Clark (puzzled): Why?

    Bob: OK, let’s say a guy comes up to me and says, “Hey, I know the
    biggest number!” Then I would say, “Oh yeah, what is it?” And the guy
    would tell me, “It’s a billion billion.” But then I would just add 1
    to it, and say, “A ha, a billion billion and 1 is a bigger number. So
    you made a mistake when you said you thought of the biggest number.”

    Clark (after a pause): What guy are you talking about?

    Bob: Just any guy. I’m saying, if anybody tries to think of the
    biggest number, I’ll always be able to do that trick-where I add 1 to
    it-so they can’t do it. They’ll always lose.

    Clark: What if a girl asks you?

    [I ran through the same thing with a girl asking me...]

    Clark: OK I want to tell the story!

    Bob: Sure go ahead.

    Clark: So what if a guy came up to me and said, “Hey Clark, I know the
    biggest number! It’s 100 billion!” Then I would say, “No, 100 billion
    and 1 is bigger! You’re wrong!”

    Bob: Right, good job. So he didn’t really think of the biggest number
    after all, did he?

    Clark: No.

    Bob: And you can always do that.

    Clark: OK let me tell it again with Sam [name possibly changed--a kid
    from his class].

    Bob: OK.

    Clark: So what if Sam came up to me and said, “Hey Clark, I know the
    biggest number. It’s 50 googol.” But I would say, “No Sam you’re
    wrong! 50 googol and 1 is bigger!” But Sam gets mad so he would start
    shouting and say, “I DID TOO THINK OF THE BIGGEST NUMBER CLARK!!”

And I know we're not supposed to quote ourselves, but you rarely get an
opportunity to use a line like this:

    I guess you already tried explaining to Clark that the cardinality of
    the natural numbers is invariant under transformations of largest
    number proponent?

    Despite the difficulty of exact Bayesian inference in complex

    used in everyday life. One example has been immortalized in the words
    of Sherlock Holmes to his friend Dr. Watson: “How often have I said to
    you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains,
    however improbable, must be the truth?” (Arthur Conan Doyle, The Sign
    of Four, 1890, Ch. 6). This reasoning is actually a consequence of
    Bayesian belief updating, as expressed in Equation 4.4. Let me
    re-state it this way: “How often have I said to you that when p(D|θ_i
    ) = 0 for all i!=j, then, no matter how small the prior p(θ_j ) 0 is,
    the posterior p(θ_j |D) must equal one.” Somehow it sounds better the

    Practically anything can go faster than Disc light, which is lazy and

    ordinary light is monarchy, according to the philosopher Ly Tin
    Wheedle.  He reasoned like this: you can't have more than one king,
    and tradition demands that there is no gap between kings, so when a
    king dies the succession must therefore pass to the heir
    instantaneously. Presumably, he said, there must be some elementary
    particles—kingons, or possibly queons—that do this job, but of course
    succession sometimes fails if, in mid-flight, they strike an
    anti-particle, or republicon. His ambitious plans to use his discovery
    to send messages, involving the careful torturing of a small king in
    order to modulate the signal, were never fully expounded because, at
    that point, the bar closed.

    ...in an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a

    information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it

    David Hume was right to predict that superstition would survive for
    hundreds of years after his death, but how could he have anticipated
    that his own work would inspire Kant to invent a whole new package of
    superstitions? Or that the incoherent system of Marx would move vast
    populations to engineer their own ruin? Or that the infantile rantings
    of the author of Mein Kampf would be capable of bringing the whole
    world to war?

    Perhaps we will one day succeed in immunizing our societies against
    such bouts of collective idiocy by establishing a social contract in
    which each child is systematically instructed in Humean skepticism.
    Such a new Emile would learn about the psychological weaknesses to
    which Homo sapiens is prey, and so would understand the wisdom of
    treating all authorities - political leaders and social role-models,
    academics and teachers, philosophers and prophets, poets and pop stars
    - as so many potential rogues and knoves, each out to exploit the
    universal human hunger for social status. He would therefore
    appreciate the necessity of doing all of his own thinking for himself.
    He would understand why and when to trust his neighbors. Above all, he
    would waste no time yearning for utopias that are incompatible with

    insight also applies to self-perception. When we turn our attention to
    our own minds, we are faced with trying to understand an unimaginably

    the tremendous number of mechanical influences on our behavior because

    “The general method that Wittgenstein does suggest is that of ’shewing
    that a man has supplied no meaning for certain signs in his
    sentences’.

    I can illustrate the method from Wittgenstein’s later way of
    discussing problems. He once greeted me with the question: ‘Why do
    people say that it was natural to think that the sun went round the
    earth rather than that the earth turned on its axis? I replied: ‘I
    suppose, because it looked as if the sun went round the earth.’
    ‘Well,’ he asked, ‘what would it have looked like if it had looked as
    if the earth turned on its axis?’

    This question brought it out that I had hitherto given no relevant
    meaning to ‘it looks as if’ in ‘it looks as if the sun goes round the
    earth’.

    My reply was to hold out my hands with the palms upward, and raise
    them from my knees in a circular sweep, at the same time leaning
    backwards and assuming a dizzy expression. ‘Exactly!’ he said.”

Could you devise an experiment to test whether it was so, would you bet on

someday? And if so, what's the point?

Now that I think on it, though, there might be a case for scientists being

    Slogans like “practice random acts of kindness” feel good and are easy

    than that, our motive is probably a desire to feel good about
    ourselves, to help ourselves or those close to us, or to act out our
    self-identity. The endpoint of authentic compassion is a desire to do
    the most good that one can, to be as effective as possible in creating
    a world with less suffering and destruction and more joy. Figuring out
    how we can do the most good takes careful thought over a long period
    of time, and it means moving into new and possibly uncomfortable areas
    of advocacy. But the importance of taking our activism seriously and
    approaching it from this utilitarian perspective cannot be overstated.

    The seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the

    of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning

    If [Ayn] Rand really wanted to build an individualist sub-culture, she
    would have done so in an evolutionarily informed way. If people
    naturally care about the opinions of others, jumping on people is a
    good way to get dishonest conformity, but a bad way to get an honest
    exchange of ideas. Instead, an individualist sub-culture must be built
    upon tolerance and honesty. I'd suggest three key norms:

        Don't think less of people who sincerely disagree.  Do think less
        of people who insincerely agree.  Do think less of people who

    Were it possible to trace the succession of ideas in the mind of Sir
    Isaac Newton, during the time that he made his greatest discoveries, I
    make no doubt but our amazement at the extent of his genius would a
    little subside. But if, when a man publishes his discoveries, he
    either through a design, or through habit, omit the intermediary steps
    by which he himself arrived at them, it is no wonder that his
    speculations confound them, and that the generality of mankind stand
    amazed at his reach of thought. If a man ascend to the top of a
    building by the help of a common ladder, but cut away most of the
    steps after he has done with them, leaving only every ninth of tenth
    step, the view of the ladder, in the condition which he has pleased to
    exhibit it, gives us a prodigious, but unjust view of the man who
    could have made use of it. But if he had intended that any body should
    follow him, he should have left the ladder as he constructed it, or
    perhaps as he found it, for it might have been a mere accident that
    threw it in his way... I think that the interests of science have
    suffered by the excessive admiration and wonder with which several
    first rate philosophers are considered, and that an opinion of the
    greater equality of mankind, in point of genius, and power of
    understanding, would be of real service in the present age." - Joseph
    Priestly, The History and present State of Electricity

The section where I've added an ellipsis is a section where he discusses
Newton in more detail. That entire part of the text is worth reading.
Priestly wrote the book before he did his work on the composition of air.
The book is, as far as I am aware, the first attempt at actual history of

    ...the 2008 financial crisis showed that some [mathematical finance]
    models were flawed. But those flaws were based on flawed assumptions
    about the distribution of price changes... Nassim Taleb, a popular
    author and critic of the financial industry, points out many such
    flaws but does not include the use of Monte Carlo simulations among
    them. He himself is a strong proponent of these simulations. Monte
    Carlo simulations are simply the way we do the math with uncertain
    quantities. Abandoning Monte Carlos because of the failures of the
    financial markets makes as much sense as giving up on addition and
    subtraction because of the failure of accounting at Enron or AIG’s
    overexposure in credit default swaps.

    2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 2 = 5, 5 - 2 =3, and 5 - 3 = 2 are not four facts, but
    four different ways of looking at one fact. Furthermore, that fact is
    not a fact of arithmetic, to be taken on faith and memorized like
    nonsense syllables. It is a fact of nature, which children can
    discover for themselves, and rediscover or verify for themselves as
    many times as they need or want to.

    The fact is this:

    ***** -- *** **

    If you have before you a group of objects--coins or stones, for
    example---that looks like the group on the left, then you can make it
    into two groups that look like the ones on the right. Or--and this is
    what the two-way arrow means---if you have two groups that look like
    the ones on the right, you can make them into a group that looks like
    the one on the left.

    This is not a fact of arithmetic, but a fact of nature. It did not
    become true only when human beings invented arithmetic. It has nothing
    to do with human beings. It is true all over the universe. One doesn't
    have to know any arithmetic to discover or verify it. An infant
    playing with blocks or a dog pawing at sticks might do that operation,
    though probably neither of them would notice that he had done it; for
    them, the difference between ***** and *** ** would be a difference
    that didn't make any difference. Arithmetic began (and begins) when
    human beings began to notice and think about this and other numerical
    facts of nature.

    We can get very confused, because we think that words must have some

    noises or marks, and they mean whatever experience you have learned to
    mean by them. People tend to use similar words in similar situations,
    but unless you have specifically agreed on what the words will mean,
    in terms of underlying experiences, there's no way to know what
    another person understands when you use them. The experience you
    attach to a word when you say it isn't automatically the same as the

    The necessity for marking our classes has brought with it a bias for
    false and excessive contrast, and we never invent a term but we are at
    once cramming it with implications beyond its legitimate content.
    There is no feat of irrelevance that people will not perform quite
    easily in this way; there is no class, however accidental, to which
    they will not at once ascribe deeply distinctive qualities. The
    seventh sons of seventh sons have remarkable powers of insight; people
    with a certain sort of ear commit crimes of violence; people with red
    hair have souls of fire; all democratic socialists are trustworthy
    persons; all people born in Ireland have vivid imaginations and all
    Englishmen are clods; all Hindoos are cowardly liars; all curly-haired
    people are good-natured; all hunch-backs are energetic and wicked, and
    all Frenchmen eat frogs. Such stupid generalisations have been
    believed with the utmost readiness, and acted upon by great numbers of
    sane, respectable people. And when the class is one's own class, when
    it expresses one of the aggregations to which one refers one's own
    activities, then the disposition to divide all qualities between this
    class and its converse, and to cram one's own class with every
    desirable distinction, becomes overwhelming.

        I balanc'd some time between principle and inclination, till I
        recollectd that, when the fish were opened, I saw smaller fish
        taken out of their stomachs; then thought I, "if you eat one
        another, I don't see why we mayn't eat you." So I din'd upon cod
        very heartily, and continued to eat with other people, returning

    is sent through space from the vortices by this pressure, which
    imparts a transitional motion to little light globules - ”

    And if this were not magical enough - mirabile dictu! - when the
    rotatory motion surpasseth the rectilinear, we see blue; when the
    reverse, we see red; and when the twain are equal, we see yellow. What

    Who first called Reason sweet, I don't know. I suspect that he was a
    man with very few responsibilities, no children to rear, and no
    payroll to meet. An anchorite with heretical tendencies, maybe, or the
    idle youngest son of a wealthy Athenian. The dictates of Reason are
    often difficult to figure out, rarely to my liking, and profitable
    only by what seems a happy but remarkably unusual accident. Mostly,
    Reason brings bad news, and bad news of the worst sort, for, if it is
    truly the word of Reason, there is no denying it or weaseling out of
    its demands without simply deciding to be irrational. Thus it is that
    I have discovered, and many others, I notice, have also discovered,
    all sorts of clever ways to convince myself that Reason is "mere"
    Reason, powerful and right, of course, but infinitely outnumbered by
    reasons, my reasons.

    Rejecting all organs of information therefore but my senses, I rid
    myself of the Pyrrhonisms with which an indulgence in speculations
    hyperphysical and antiphysical so uselessly occupy and disquiet the
    mind. A single sense may indeed be sometimes decieved, but rarely: and
    never all our senses together, with their faculty of reasoning. They
    evidence realities; and there are enough of these for all the purposes
    of life, without plunging into the fathomless abyss of dreams and
    phantasms. I am satisfied, and sufficiently occupied with the things
    which are, without tormenting or troubling myself about those which
    may indeed be, but of which I have no evidence.

    I am sure that I really know many, many, things, and none more surely
    than that I love you with all my heart, and pray for the continuance
    of your life until you shall be tired of it yourself.

    The ultimate theological question is: ‘Where does the Sun go at
    night?’.

    The answer that so many civilisations agreed for so long was: ‘The Sun
    is driven by one of the gods, and at night it goes under the Earth to
    fight a battle. There is at least some risk that the god will lose
    this battle, and so the Sun may not rise tomorrow’. It’s something the
    human race understood was a cast iron fact before they knew how to
    cast iron. It survived as the working model twenty-five times longer
    than the four hundred years we’ve understood the Earth goes around the
    Sun.

    But even as light is opposed by darkness, science and reason have
    their enemies. Superstition and belief in magic are as old as man
    himself; for the intransigence of facts and our limitations in
    controlling them can be powerfully hard to take. Add to this the
    reflection that we are in an age when it is popular to distrust
    whatever is seen as the established view or the Establishment, and it
    is no wonder that anti-rational attitudes and doctrines are mustering
    so much support. Still, we can understand what encourages the
    anti-rationalist turn without losing our zeal for opposing it. A
    current Continuing Education catalogue offers a course description,
    under the heading "Philosophy", that typifies the dark view at its
    darkest: "Children of science that we are, we have based our cultural
    patterns on logic, on the cognitive, on the verifiable. But more and
    more there has crept into current research and study the haunting
    suggestion that there are other kinds of knowledge unfathomable by our
    cognition, other ways of knowing beyond the limits of our logic, which
    are deserving of our serious attention." Now "knowledge unfathomable
    by our cognition" is simply incoherent, as attention to the words
    makes clear. Moreover, all that creeps is not gold. One wonders how

    Whether a mathematical proposition is true or not is indeed
    independent of physics. But the proof of such a proposition is a
    matter of physics only. There is no such thing as abstractly proving
    something, just as there is no such thing as abstractly knowing

    [Instrumentalism about science] has a long and rather sorry

    regard it as fairly conclusively refuted. But I think it’s easier to
    see what’s wrong with it just by noticing that real science just isn’t
    like this. According to instrumentalism, palaeontologists talk about
    dinosaurs so they can understand fossils, astrophysicists talk about
    stars so they can understand photoplates, virologists talk about
    viruses so they can understand NMR instruments, and particle
    physicists talk about the Higgs Boson so they can understand the LHC.

    A fragment of what you felt, of what you knew,

    A formula, a phrase remains, -- but the best is lost.

    The answers quick keen, the honest look, the laughter, the love,

    They are gone. They have gone to feed the roses. Elegant and curled

    Is the blossom. Fragrant is the blossom. I know. But I do not approve.

    More precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.

    Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave

    Suppose we know someone's objective and also know that half the time
    that person correctly figures out how to achieve it and half the time
    he acts at random. Since there is generally only one right way of
    doing things (or perhaps a few) but very many wrong ways, the
    "rational" behavior can be predicted but the "irrational" behavior
    cannot. If we predict the person's behavior on the assumption that he
    is rational, we will be right half the time. If we assume he is
    irrational, we will almost never be right, since we still have to
    guess which irrational thing he will do. We are better off assuming he
    is rational and recognizing that we will sometimes be wrong. To put
    the argument more generally, the tendency to be rational is the
    consistent (and hence predictable) element in human behavior. The only
    alternative to assuming rationality (other than giving up and assuming
    that human behavior cannot be understood and predicted) would be a
    theory of irrational behavior - a theory that told us not only that
    someone would not always do the rational thing but also which
    particular irrational thing he would do. So far as I know, no
    satisfactory theory of that sort exists.

    It cannot have escaped philosophers' attention that our fellow
    academics in other fields--especially in the sciences--often have
    difficulty suppressing their incredulous amusement when such topics as
    Twin Earth, Swampman, and Blockheads are posed for apparently serious
    consideration. Are the scientists just being philistines, betraying
    their tin ears for the subtleties of philosophical investigation, or
    have the philosophers who indulge in these exercises lost their grip
    on reality?

    These bizarre examples all attempt to prove one "conceptual" point or
    another by deliberately reducing something underappreciated to zero,
    so that What Really Counts can shine through. Blockheads hold
    peripheral behavior constant and reduce internal structural details
    (and--what comes to the same thing--intervening internal processes)
    close to zero, and provoke the intuition that then there would be no
    mind there; internal structure Really Counts. Manthra is more or less
    the mirror-image; it keeps internal processes constant and reduces
    control of peripheral behavior to zero, showing, presumably, that
    external behavior Really Doesn't Count. Swampman keeps both future
    peripheral dispositions and internal states constant and reduces
    "history" to zero. Twin Earth sets internal similarity to maximum, so
    that external context can be demonstrated to be responsible for
    whatever our intuitions tell us. Thus these thought experiments mimic
    empirical experiments in their design, attempting to isolate a crucial
    interaction between variables by holding other variables constant. In
    the past I have often noted that a problem with such experiments is
    that the dependent variable is "intuition"--they are intuition
    pumps--and the contribution of imagination in the generation of
    intuitions is harder to control than philosophers have usually
    acknowledged.

    But there is also a deeper problem with them. It is child's play to
    dream up further such examples to "prove" further conceptual points.
    Suppose a cow gave birth to something that was atom-for-atom
    indiscernible from a shark. Would it be a shark? What is the
    truth-maker for sharkhood? If you posed that question to a biologist,
    the charitable reaction would be that you were making a labored
    attempt at a joke. Suppose an evil demon could make water turn solid
    at room temperature by smiling at it; would demon-water be ice? Too
    silly a hypothesis to deserve a response. All such intuition pumps
    depend on the distinction spelled out by McLaughlin and
    O'Leary-Hawthorne between "conceptual" and "reductive" answers to the
    big questions. What I hadn't sufficiently appreciated in my earlier
    forthright response to Jackson is that when one says that the
    truth-maker question requires a conceptual answer, one means an answer
    that holds not just in our world, or all nomologically possible
    worlds, but in all logically possible worlds. Smiling demons,
    cow-sharks, Blockheads, and Swampmen are all, some philosophers think,
    logically possible, even if they are not nomologically possible, and
    these philosophers think this is important. I do not. Why should the
    truth-maker question cast its net this wide? Because, I gather,
    otherwise its answer doesn't tell us about the essence of the topic in
    question. But who believes in real essences of this sort nowadays? Not
    I.

    readily believes. Therefore he rejects difficult things from

    In short, and I can't emphasize this strongly enough, a fundamental
    issue that any theory of psychology ultimately has to face is that
    brains are useful. They guide behavior. Any brain that didn't cause
    its owner to do useful--in the evolutionary sense--things, didn't
    cause reproduction.

    But when we have these irrational beliefs, these culturally coded
    assumptions, running so deep within our community and movement, how do
    we actually change that? How do we get people to further question
    themselves when they’ve already become convinced that they’re a
    rational person, a skeptic, and have moved on from irrationality,
    cognitive distortion and bias?

    Well I think what we need to do is to change the fundamental structure
    and values of skepticism. We need to build our community and movement
    around slightly different premises.

    As it has stood in the past, skepticism has been predicated on a
    belief in the power of the empirical and rational. It has been based
    on the premise that there is an empirical truth, and that it is
    knowable, and that certain tools and strategies like science and logic
    will allow us to reach that truth. In short, the “old guard”
    skepticism was based on a veneration of the rational. But the
    veneration of certain techniques or certain philosophies creates the
    problematic possibility of choosing to consider certain conclusions or
    beliefs to BE empirical and rational and above criticism, particularly
    beliefs derived from the “right” tools, and even more dangerously, to
    consider oneself “rational”.

    ...

    I believe that in order to be able to question our own beliefs as well
    as we question those of others, we need to restructure skepticism
    around awareness of human limitation, irrationality and flaws. Rather
    than venerating the rational, and aspiring to become some kind of
    superhuman fully rational vulcan minds, we need to instead create a
    more human skepticism, built around understanding how belief operates,
    how we draw conclusions, and how we can cope with the human
    limitations. I believe we need to remove the focus from aspiring
    towards ridding ourselves of the irrational, and instead move the
    focus towards understanding how this irrationality operates and why we
    believe all the crazy things we believe. We need to position as our
    primary aspiration not the achievement of a perfect comprehending
    mind, but instead an ability to maintain constant hesitation and
    doubt, to always always ALWAYS second-guess our positions and
    understand that they’re being created through a flawed mind, from
    flawed perceptions.

    Science and reason are excellent tools to allow us to cope with being
    crazy, irrational human beings, but it CANNOT allow us to transcend
    that. The instant we begin to believe that we have become A Skeptic, A
    Rational Person, that is when we’ve fucked up, that is when we stop
    practicing skepticism, stop keeping an eye out for our mistakes, and
    begin to imagine our irrational perceptions as perfect rational
    conclusions. It’s only by building a skepticism based on the practice
    of doubt, rather than the state of Skeptic, that we’ll truly be able
    to be move on from our assumptions.

    If we see in each generation the conflict of the future against the
    past, the fight of what might be called progressive versus
    reactionary, we shall find ourselves organizing the historical story
    upon what is really an unfolding principle of progress, and our eyes
    will be fixed upon certain people who appear as the special agencies
    of that progress. [...] But if we see in each generation a clash of
    wills out of which there emerges something that probably no man ever
    willed, our minds become concentrated upon the process that produced
    such an unpredictable issue, and we are more open for an intensive
    study of the motions and interactions that underlie historical change.
    [...] The process of the historical transition will then be recognized
    to be unlike what the whig historian seems to assume - much less like
    the procedure of a logical argument and perhaps much more like the
    method by which a man can be imagined to work his way out of a
    "complex". It is a process which moves by mediations and those
    mediations may be provided by anything in the world - by men’s sins or
    misapprehensions or by what we can only call fortunate conjunctures.
    Very strange bridges are used to make the passage from one state of
    things to another; we may lose sight of them in our surveys of general
    history, but their discovery is the glory of historical research.
    History is not the study of origins; rather it is the analysis of all
    the mediations by which the past was turned into our present.

    When I became convinced that the Universe is natural — that all the
    ghosts and gods are myths, there entered into my brain, into my soul,
    into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, the joy of
    freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell, the dungeon was
    flooded with light, and all the bolts, and bars, and manacles became
    dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf, or a slave. There was for me
    no master in all the wide world — not even in infinite space. I was
    free — free to think, to express my thoughts — free to live to my own
    ideal — free to live for myself and those I loved — free to use all my
    faculties, all my senses — free to spread imagination’s wings — free
    to investigate, to guess and dream and hope — free to judge and
    determine for myself — free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds,
    all the “inspired” books that savages have produced, and all the
    barbarous legends of the past — free from the popes and priests — free
    from all the “called” and “set apart” — free from sanctified mistakes
    and holy lies — free from the fear of eternal pain — free from the
    winged monsters of the night — free from devils, ghosts, and gods. For
    the first time I was free. There were no prohibited places in all the
    realms of thought — no air, no space, where fancy could not spread her
    painted wings — no chains for my limbs — no lashes for my back — no
    fires for my flesh — no master’s frown or threat — no following
    another’s steps — no need to bow, or cringe, or crawl, or utter lying
    words. I was free. I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously, faced all
    worlds.

    And then my heart was filled with gratitude, with thankfulness, and
    went out in love to all the heroes, the thinkers who gave for the
    liberty of hand and brain — for the freedom of labor and thought — to
    those who fell in the fierce fields of war, to those who died in
    dungeons bound with chains — to those who proudly mounted scaffold’s
    stairs — to those whose bones were crushed, whose flesh was scarred
    and torn — to those by fire consumed — to all the wise, the good, the
    brave of every land, whose thoughts and deeds have given freedom to
    the sons of men. And then I vowed to grasp the torch that they had
    held, and hold it high, that light might conquer darkness still.

    Witching was turning out to be mostly hard work and really short on
    magic of the zap!-glingle-glingle-glingle variety. There was no school
    and nothing that was exactly like a lesson. But it wasn’t wise to try
    to learn witching all by yourself, especially if you had a natural
    talent. If you got it wrong, you could go from ignorant to cackling in
    a week ...

    When you got right down to it, it was all about cackling. No one ever
    talked about this, though. Witches said things like “You can never be
    too old, too skinny, or too warty,” but they never mentioned the
    cackling. Not properly. They watched out for it, though, all the time.

    It was all too easy to become a cackler. Most witches lived by
    themselves (cat optional) and might go for weeks without ever seeing
    another witch.  In those times when people hated witches, they were
    often accused of talking to their cats. Of course they talked to their
    cats. After three weeks without an intelligent conversation that
    wasn’t about cows, you’d talk to the wall. And that was an early sign
    of cackling.

    “Cackling,” to a witch, didn’t just mean nasty laughter. It meant your
    mind drifting away from its anchor. It meant you losing your grip. It
    meant loneliness and hard work and responsibility and other people’s
    problems driving you crazy a little bit at a time, each bit so small
    that you’d hardly notice it, until you thought that it was normal to
    stop washing and wear a kettle on your head. It meant you thinking
    that the fact you knew more than anyone else in your village made you
    better than them. It meant thinking that right and wrong were
    negotiable. And, in the end, it meant you “going to the dark,” as the
    witches said. That was a bad road. At the end of that road were
    poisoned spinning wheels and gingerbread cottages.

    What stopped this was the habit of visiting. Witches visited other
    witches all the time, sometimes traveling quite a long way for a cup
    of tea and a bun. Partly this was for gossip, of course, because
    witches love gossip, especially if it’s more exciting than truthful.
    But mostly it was to keep an eye on one another.

    Today Tiffany was visiting Granny Weatherwax, who was in the opinion
    of most witches (including Granny herself) the most powerful witch in
    the mountains. It was all very polite. No one said, “Not gone bats,
    then?” or “Certainly not! I’m as sharp as a spoon!” They didn’t need
    to. They understood what it was all about, so they talked of other
    things. But when she was in a mood, Granny Weatherwax could be hard
    work.

    In life as in poker, the occasional coup does not necessarily
    demonstrate skill and superlative performance is not the ability to
    eliminate chance, but the capacity to deliver good outcomes over and

    It is quite easy to show, decision-theoretically, that the greatest
    chance of survival generally belongs to those who have most of their
    beliefs about things which affect our survival ability true.
    Philosophy, however, is totally irrelevant to survival from an
    evolutionary point of view. Natural selection has no way of weeding
    out veridical intuitions about the basic constitution of matter, for
    instance, from false ones, because humans have not generally been
    killed before they can procreate due to having erroneous metaphysical
    intuitions. Or bluntly put: having a true metaphysical theory does not
    help you getting laid.

    The intellect, as a means for the preservation of the individual,
    unfolds its chief powers in simulation; for this is the means by which
    the weaker, less robust individuals preserve themselves, since they
    are denied the chance of waging the struggle for existence with horns
    or the fangs of beasts of prey. In man this art of simulation reaches
    its peak: here deception, flattering, lying and cheating, talking
    behind the back, posing, living in borrowed splendor, being masked,
    the disguise of convention, acting a role before others and before
    oneself—in short, the constant fluttering around the single flame of
    vanity is so much the rule and the law that almost nothing is more
    incomprehensible than how an honest and pure urge for truth could make
    its appearance among men. They are deeply immersed in illusions and
    dream images; their eye glides only over the surface of things and
    sees "forms"; their feeling nowhere lead into truth, but contents

On specificity and sneaking on connotations; useful for the liberal-minded
among us:

    I think, with racism and sexism and 'isms' generally, there's a sort
    of confusion of terminology.

    A "Racist1" is someone, who, like a majority of people in this
    society, has subconsciously internalized some negative attitudes about
    minority racial groups. If a Racist1 takes the Implicit Association
    Test, her score shows she's biased against black people, like the
    majority of people (of all races) who took the test. Chances are,
    whether you know it or not, you're a Racist1.

    A "Racist2" is someone who's kind of an insensitive jerk about race.
    The kind of guy who calls Obama the "Food Stamp President." Someone
    you wouldn't want your sister dating.

    A "Racist3" is a neo-Nazi. You can never be quite sure that one day he
    won't snap and kill someone. He's clearly a social deviant.

    People use the word "Racist" for all three things, and I think that's
    the source of a lot of arguments. When people get accused of being
    racists, they evade responsibility by saying, "Hey, I'm not a
    Racist3!" when in fact you were only saying they were Racist1 or
    Racist2. But some of the responsibility is on the accusers too -- if
    you say "That Republican's a racist" with the implication of "a jerk"
    and then backtrack and change the meaning to "vulnerable to
    unconscious bias", then you're arguing in bad faith. Never mind that
    some laws and rules which were meant to protect people from Racist3's
    are in fact deployed against Racist2's.

    To understand our civilisation, one must appreciate that the extended
    order resulted not from human design or intention but spontaneously:
    it arose from unintentionally conforming to certain traditional and
    largely moral practices, many of which men tend to dislike, whose
    significance they usually fail to understand, whose validity they
    cannot prove, and which have nonetheless fairly rapidly spread by
    means of an evolutionary selection — the comparative increase of
    population and wealth — of those groups that happened to follow them.
    The unwitting, reluctant, even painful adoption of these practices
    kept these groups together, increased their access to valuable
    information of all sorts, and enabled them to be 'fruitful, and
    multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it' (Genesis 1:28). This
    process is perhaps the least appreciated facet of human evolution.

An excerpt from Wise Man's Fear, by Patrick Rothfuss. Boxing is not safe.

    The innkeeper looked up. "I have to admit I don't see the trouble," he
    said apologetically. "I've seen monsters, Bast. The Cthaeh falls short
    of that."

    "That was the wrong word for me to use, Reshi," Bast admitted. "But I
    can't think of a better one. If there was a word that meant poisonous
    and hateful and contagious, I'd use that."

    Bast drew a deep breath and leaned forward in his chair. "Reshi, the
    Cthaeh can see the future. Not in some vague, oracular way. It sees
    all the future. Clearly. Perfectly. Everything that can possibly come
    to pass, branching out endlessly from the current moment."

    Kvothe raised an eyebrow. "It can, can it?"

    "It can," Bast said gravely. "And it is purely, perfectly malicious.
    This isn't a problem for the most part, as it can't leave the tree.
    But when someone comes to visit..."

    Kvothe's eyes went distant as he nodded to himself. "If it knows the
    future perfectly," he said slowly, "then it must know exactly how a
    person will react to anything it says."

    Bast nodded. "And it is vicious, Reshi."

    Kvothe continued in a musing tone. "That means anyone influenced by
    the Cthaeh would be like an arrow shot into the future."

    "An arrow only hits on person, Reshi." Bast's dark eyes were hollow
    and hopeless. "Anyone influenced by the Cthaeh is like a plague ship
    sailing for a harbor." Bast pointed at the half-filled sheet
    Chronicler held in his lap. "If the Sithe knew that existed, they
    would spare no effort to destroy it. They would kill us for having
    heard what the Cthaeh said."

    "Because anything carrying the Cthaeh's influence away from the
    tree..." Kvothe said, looking down at his hands. He sat silently for a
    long moment, nodding thoughtfully. "So a young man seeking his fortune
    goes to the Cthaeh and takes away a flower. The daughter of the king
    is deathly ill, and he takes the flower to heal her. They fall in love
    despite the fact that she's betrothed to the neighboring prince..."

    Bast stared at Kvothe, watching blankly as he spoke.

    "They attempt a daring moonlight escape," Kvothe continued. "But he
    falls from the rooftops and they're caught. The princess is married
    against her will and stabs the neighboring prince on their wedding
    night. The prince dies. Civil war. Fields burned and salted. Famine.
    Plague..."

    "That's the story of the Fastingsway War," Bast said faintly.

    It is neither desirable nor any longer effective to try bullying

    order to experience the true nature and value of scientific inquiry.
    This does not mean listening to professional scientists tell
    condescending stories about how they have discovered wonderful things,
    which you should believe for reasons that are too difficult for you to
    understand in real depth and detail. Doing science ought to mean
    asking your own questions, making your own investigations, and drawing
    your own conclusions for your own reasons. Of course it will not be
    feasible to advance the "cutting edge" or "frontier" of modern science
    without first acquiring years of specialist training. However, the
    cutting edge is not all there is to science, nor is it necessarily the
    most valuable part of science. Questions that have been answered are
    still worth asking again, so you can understand for yourself how to
    arrive at the standard answers, and possibly discover new answers or
    recover forgotten answers that are valuable.

    It's easy to put down the shallow concerns of life, but in a way they
    are what life is about. Deeper concerns that don't connect in any way
    to economic wealth, social status, physical pleasure, etc., are not
    really deep but pointless. The shallow concerns all pertain to the
    lowest common denominator of human life because they really are the
    basic fabric of everyone's life. They're concerns that everyone shares

    The master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers
    from him. His calculations were already finished. In a small white

    awake and active for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit,
    patient as ever, he had given his lecture to his students, and then
    had come back at once to this momentous calculation. His face was
    grave, a little drawn and hectic from his drugged activity. For some
    time he seemed lost in thought.  Then he went to the window, and the
    blind went up with a click. Half way up the sky, over the clustering
    roofs, chimneys and steeples of the city, hung the star.

    He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. "You

    his agreement with the truth which we see, which he had the luck to
    see first. And originality, what is that? It is being; being somebody,
    being yourself, reporting accurately what you see are. If another's

The Princess Bride:

Man in Black: Inhale this, but do not touch.

Vizzini: [sniffs] I smell nothing.

Man in Black: What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is
odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more
deadlier poisons known to man.

[He puts the goblets behind his back and puts the poison into one of the
goblets, then sets them down in front of him]

Man in Black: All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits has
begun. It ends when you decide and we both drink, and find out who is
right... and who is dead.

[Vizzini stalls, then eventually chooses the glass in front of the man in
black. They both drink, and Vizzini dies.]

Buttercup: And to think, all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.

Man in Black: They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building
up an immunity to iocane powder.

    Suppose you know a golfer's score on day 1 and are asked to predict
    his score on day 2. You expect the golfer to retain the same level of
    talent on the second day, so your best guesses will be "above average"
    for the [better-scoring] player and "below average" for the
    [worse-scoring] player. Luck, of course, is a different matter. Since
    you have no way of predicting the golfers' luck on the second (or any)
    day, your best guess must be that it will be average, neither good nor
    bad. This means that in the absence of any other information, your
    best guess about the players' score on day 2 should not be a repeat of
    their performance on day 1. ...

    The best predicted performance on day 2 is more moderate, closer to
    the average than the evidence on which it is based (the score on day
    1). This is why the pattern is called regression to the mean. The more
    extreme the original score, the more regression we expect, because an
    extremely good score suggests a very lucky day. The regressive
    prediction is reasonable, but its accuracy is not guaranteed. A few of
    the golfers who scored 66 on day 1 will do even better on the second
    day, if their luck improves. Most will do worse, because their luck
    will no longer be above average.

    Now let us go against the time arrow. Arrange the players by their
    performance on day 2 and look at their performance on day 1. You will
    find precisely the same pattern of regression to the mean. ... The
    fact that you observe regression when you predict an early event from
    a later event should help convince you that regression does not have a
    causal explanation.

    Don't kid yourself, just because you got the correct numerical answer
    to a problem is not justification that you understand the physics of
    the problem. You must understand all the logical steps in arriving at
    that solution or you have gained nothing, right answer or not.

    For a hundred years or so, mathematical statisticians have been in
    love with the fact that the probability distribution of the sum of a
    very large number of very small random deviations almost always
    converges to a normal distribution. ... This infatuation tended to
    focus interest away from the fact that, for real data, the normal
    distribution is often rather poorly realized, if it is realized at
    all. We are often taught, rather casually, that, on average,
    measurements will fall within ±σ of the true value 68% of the time,
    within ±2σ 95% of the time, and within ±3σ 99.7% of the time.
    Extending this, one would expect a measurement to be off by ±20σ only
    one time out of 2 × 10^88. We all know that “glitches” are much more
    likely than that!

    As far as I know, Robespierre, Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot were
    indeed unusually incorruptible, and I do hate them for this trait.

    Why? Because when your goal is mass murder, corruption saves lives.
    Corruption leads you to take the easy way out, to compromise, to go
    along to get along. Corruption isn't a poison that makes everything
    worse. It's a diluting agent like water. Corruption makes good
    policies less good, and evil policies less evil.

    I've read thousands of pages about Hitler. I can't recall the
    slightest hint of "corruption" on his record. Like Robespierre, Lenin,
    Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot, Hitler was a sincerely murderous fanatic.
    The same goes for many of history's leading villains - see Eric
    Hoffer's classic The True Believer. Sincerity is so overrated. If only
    these self-righteous monsters had been corrupt hypocrites, millions of
    their victims could have bargained and bribed their way out of hell.

    Chris Cillizza says that [...] the surge in the quantity of public
    polling available creates a confusing fog of numbers in which
    "partisans, who already live in a choose-your-own-political-reality
    world, can select the numbers that comply with their view of the race
    and pooh-pooh the data that suggest anything different."

    That's true. But if you actually want to know what's happening in the
    race the increased poll volume makes it clearer not less clear. The
    sense that the polls are "all over the map" is the mistake. You need
    to think of each datapoint as having an associated probability
    distribution and then look at where they overlap. [...] The fact that
    we now have tons of polling that averages out to [a] conclusion means
    the scope for "sampling error" to throw us off is, at this point,
    tiny. One poll showing a lead of the current magnitude would leave us
    with a ton of uncertainty, but a bunch of polls makes the picture
    pretty clear.

    I don't have any previous experience with this sort of thing, but
    judging from what I hear and read, I'm supposed to be asking why all
    this is happening, and why it's happening to me. Honestly, those
    questions are about the farthest thing from my mind.

    Partly, that’s because they aren't hard questions. Why does our world
    have gravity? Why does the sun rise in the East? There are technical
    answers, but the metaphysical answer is simple: that’s how reality
    works. So too here. Only in the richest parts of the rich world of the
    twenty-first century could anyone entertain the thought that we should
    expect long, pain-free lives. Suffering and premature death (an odd
    phrase: what does it mean to call death "premature"?) are constant
    presences in the lives of most of the peoples of the Earth, and were
    routine parts of life for generations of our predecessors in this
    country—as they still are today, for those with their eyes open. Stage
    4 cancers happen to middle-aged men and women, seemingly out of the
    blue, because that's how reality works.

    As for why this is happening to me in particular, the implicit point
    of the question is an argument: I deserve better than this. There are
    two responses. First, I don't—I have no greater moral claim to be free
    from unwanted pain and loss than anyone else. Plenty of people more
    virtuous than I am suffer worse than I have, and some who don't seem
    virtuous at all skate through life with surprising ease. Welcome to
    the world. Once again, it seems to me that this claim arises from the
    incredibly unusual experience of a small class of wealthy
    professionals in the wealthiest parts of the world today. We think we
    live in a world governed by merit and moral desert. It isn't so. Luck,
    fortune, fate, providence—call it what you will, but whatever your
    preferred label, it has far more to do with the successes of the
    successful than what any of us deserves. Aristocracies of the past
    awarded wealth and position based on the accident of birth. Today's
    meritocracies award wealth and position based on the accident of being
    in the right place at the right time. The difference is smaller than
    we tend to think. Once you understand that, it’s hard to maintain a
    sense of grievance in the face of even the ugliest medical news. I’ve
    won more than my share of life's lotteries. It would seem churlish to
    rail at the unfairness of losing this one—if indeed I do lose it:
    which I may not.

    The second response is simpler; it comes from the movie "Unforgiven."
    Gene Hackman is dying, and says to Clint Eastwood: "I don't deserve
    this. To die like this. I was building a house." Eastwood responds:
    "Deserve’s got nothing to do with it."

    That gets it right, I think. It's a messed-up world, upside-down as
    often as it's rightside up. Bad things happen; future plans (that
    house Hackman was building) come to naught. Deserve's got nothing to
    do with it.
